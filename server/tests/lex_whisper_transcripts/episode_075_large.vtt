00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
 The following is a conversation with Marcus Hutter,

00:03.480 --> 00:06.680
 senior research scientist at Google DeepMind.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.360
 Throughout his career of research,

00:08.360 --> 00:11.760
 including with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legge,

00:11.760 --> 00:13.960
 he has proposed a lot of interesting ideas

00:13.960 --> 00:16.360
 in and around the field of artificial general

00:16.360 --> 00:20.140
 intelligence, including the development of AICSI,

00:20.140 --> 00:25.360
 spelled AIXI model, which is a mathematical approach to AGI

00:25.360 --> 00:28.880
 that incorporates ideas of Kolmogorov complexity,

00:28.880 --> 00:33.080
 Solomonov induction, and reinforcement learning.

00:33.080 --> 00:38.200
 In 2006, Marcus launched the 50,000 Euro Hutter Prize

00:38.200 --> 00:41.200
 for lossless compression of human knowledge.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.720
 The idea behind this prize is that the ability

00:43.720 --> 00:47.900
 to compress well is closely related to intelligence.

00:47.900 --> 00:51.260
 This, to me, is a profound idea.

00:51.260 --> 00:54.000
 Specifically, if you can compress the first 100

00:54.000 --> 00:56.520
 megabytes or 1 gigabyte of Wikipedia

00:56.520 --> 00:59.000
 better than your predecessors, your compressor

00:59.000 --> 01:02.200
 likely has to also be smarter.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.240
 The intention of this prize is to encourage

01:04.240 --> 01:09.640
 the development of intelligent compressors as a path to AGI.

01:09.640 --> 01:13.280
 In conjunction with his podcast release just a few days ago,

01:13.280 --> 01:16.520
 Marcus announced a 10x increase in several aspects

01:16.520 --> 01:22.680
 of this prize, including the money, to 500,000 Euros.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.240
 The better your compressor works relative to the previous

01:25.240 --> 01:27.680
 winners, the higher fraction of that prize money

01:27.680 --> 01:29.440
 is awarded to you.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.080
 You can learn more about it if you Google simply Hutter Prize.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.240
 I'm a big fan of benchmarks for developing AI systems,

01:38.240 --> 01:39.960
 and the Hutter Prize may indeed be

01:39.960 --> 01:43.240
 one that will spark some good ideas for approaches that

01:43.240 --> 01:47.880
 will make progress on the path of developing AGI systems.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.520
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.720
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:52.720 --> 01:54.720
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:54.720 --> 01:58.040
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:58.040 --> 02:02.640
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.840
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads

02:04.840 --> 02:06.960
 now and never any ads in the middle

02:06.960 --> 02:09.240
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.040
 I hope that works for you and doesn't

02:11.040 --> 02:13.240
 hurt the listening experience.

02:13.240 --> 02:16.400
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance

02:16.400 --> 02:17.800
 app in the App Store.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.240
 When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.520
 Cash App lets you send money to friends,

02:23.520 --> 02:26.040
 buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market

02:26.040 --> 02:27.920
 with as little as $1.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.920
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:30.920 --> 02:34.960
 a subsidiary of Square, a member SIPC.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.400
 Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money

02:37.400 --> 02:39.920
 digitally, peer to peer, and security

02:39.920 --> 02:42.800
 in all digital transactions is very important.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.840
 Let me mention the PCI data security standard

02:45.840 --> 02:48.080
 that Cash App is compliant with.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.080
 I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.080
 PCI DSS is a good example of that,

02:55.080 --> 02:57.200
 where a bunch of competitors got together

02:57.200 --> 02:59.000
 and agreed that there needs to be

02:59.000 --> 03:02.520
 a global standard around the security of transactions.

03:02.520 --> 03:06.040
 Now, we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles

03:06.040 --> 03:08.880
 and AI systems in general.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.920
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google

03:11.920 --> 03:16.400
 Play and use the code LEX PODCAST, you'll get $10.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.240
 And Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.380
 one of my favorite organizations that

03:21.380 --> 03:24.520
 is helping to advance robotics and STEM education

03:24.520 --> 03:26.760
 for young people around the world.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.680
 And now, here's my conversation with Markus Hutter.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.480
 Do you think of the universe as a computer

03:34.480 --> 03:37.020
 or maybe an information processing system?

03:37.020 --> 03:39.080
 Let's go with a big question first.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.560
 Okay, with a big question first.

03:41.560 --> 03:45.240
 I think it's a very interesting hypothesis or idea.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.960
 And I have a background in physics,

03:47.960 --> 03:50.800
 so I know a little bit about physical theories,

03:50.800 --> 03:52.440
 the standard model of particle physics

03:52.440 --> 03:54.440
 and general relativity theory.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.200
 And they are amazing and describe virtually everything

03:57.200 --> 03:58.040
 in the universe.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.780
 And they're all in a sense, computable theories.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.800
 I mean, they're very hard to compute.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.360
 And it's very elegant, simple theories,

04:04.360 --> 04:07.260
 which describe virtually everything in the universe.

04:07.260 --> 04:12.260
 So there's a strong indication that somehow

04:12.400 --> 04:17.400
 the universe is computable, but it's a plausible hypothesis.

04:17.400 --> 04:21.200
 So what do you think, just like you said, general relativity,

04:21.200 --> 04:23.680
 quantum field theory, what do you think that

04:23.680 --> 04:26.560
 the laws of physics are so nice and beautiful

04:26.560 --> 04:29.000
 and simple and compressible?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.800
 Do you think our universe was designed,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.240
 is naturally this way?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.760
 Are we just focusing on the parts

04:36.760 --> 04:39.560
 that are especially compressible?

04:39.560 --> 04:42.780
 Are human minds just enjoy something about that simplicity?

04:42.780 --> 04:44.880
 And in fact, there's other things

04:44.880 --> 04:46.760
 that are not so compressible.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.440
 I strongly believe and I'm pretty convinced

04:49.440 --> 04:52.560
 that the universe is inherently beautiful, elegant

04:52.560 --> 04:55.520
 and simple and described by these equations.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.640
 And we're not just picking that.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.040
 I mean, if there were some phenomena

05:00.040 --> 05:02.680
 which cannot be neatly described,

05:02.680 --> 05:04.640
 scientists would try that.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.720
 And there's biology, which is more messy,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.280
 but we understand that it's an emergent phenomena

05:09.280 --> 05:11.000
 and it's complex systems,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.720
 but they still follow the same rules

05:12.720 --> 05:14.640
 of quantum and electrodynamics.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.560
 All of chemistry follows that and we know that.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.120
 I mean, we cannot compute everything

05:18.120 --> 05:20.280
 because we have limited computational resources.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.040
 No, I think it's not a bias of the humans,

05:22.040 --> 05:23.960
 but it's objectively simple.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.640
 I mean, of course, you never know,

05:25.640 --> 05:28.280
 maybe there's some corners very far out in the universe

05:28.280 --> 05:32.960
 or super, super tiny below the nucleus of atoms

05:32.960 --> 05:37.960
 or parallel universes which are not nice and simple,

05:38.200 --> 05:40.520
 but there's no evidence for that.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.200
 And we should apply Occam's razor

05:42.200 --> 05:45.120
 and choose the simplest three consistent with it.

05:45.120 --> 05:48.000
 But also it's a little bit self referential.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.440
 So maybe a quick pause.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.960
 What is Occam's razor?

05:50.960 --> 05:55.520
 So Occam's razor says that you should not multiply entities

05:55.520 --> 05:58.040
 beyond necessity, which sort of,

05:58.040 --> 06:01.360
 if you translate it to proper English means,

06:01.360 --> 06:03.400
 and in the scientific context means

06:03.400 --> 06:06.400
 that if you have two theories or hypothesis or models,

06:06.400 --> 06:09.760
 which equally well describe the phenomenon,

06:09.760 --> 06:11.520
 your study or the data,

06:11.520 --> 06:13.920
 you should choose the more simple one.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.640
 So that's just the principle or sort of,

06:16.640 --> 06:20.040
 that's not like a provable law, perhaps.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.480
 Perhaps we'll kind of discuss it and think about it,

06:23.480 --> 06:28.080
 but what's the intuition of why the simpler answer

06:28.080 --> 06:33.080
 is the one that is likely to be more correct descriptor

06:33.280 --> 06:35.080
 of whatever we're talking about?

06:35.080 --> 06:36.560
 I believe that Occam's razor

06:36.560 --> 06:40.240
 is probably the most important principle in science.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.040
 I mean, of course we lead logical deduction

06:42.040 --> 06:44.560
 and we do experimental design,

06:44.560 --> 06:49.560
 but science is about finding, understanding the world,

06:49.880 --> 06:51.480
 finding models of the world.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.720
 And we can come up with crazy complex models,

06:53.720 --> 06:56.040
 which explain everything but predict nothing.

06:56.040 --> 07:00.240
 But the simple model seem to have predictive power

07:00.240 --> 07:03.160
 and it's a valid question why?

07:03.160 --> 07:06.000
 And there are two answers to that.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.240
 You can just accept it.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.800
 That is the principle of science and we use this principle

07:10.800 --> 07:12.840
 and it seems to be successful.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.920
 We don't know why, but it just happens to be.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.560
 Or you can try, find another principle

07:18.560 --> 07:21.120
 which explains Occam's razor.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.120
 And if we start with the assumption

07:24.120 --> 07:27.600
 that the world is governed by simple rules,

07:27.600 --> 07:31.400
 then there's a bias towards simplicity

07:31.400 --> 07:36.200
 and applying Occam's razor is the mechanism

07:36.200 --> 07:37.120
 to finding these rules.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.080
 And actually in a more quantitative sense,

07:39.080 --> 07:41.760
 and we come back to that later in terms of somnolent reduction,

07:41.760 --> 07:43.080
 you can rigorously prove that.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.680
 You can assume that the world is simple,

07:45.680 --> 07:47.800
 then Occam's razor is the best you can do

07:47.800 --> 07:49.080
 in a certain sense.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.720
 So I apologize for the romanticized question,

07:51.720 --> 07:56.320
 but why do you think, outside of its effectiveness,

07:56.320 --> 07:58.440
 why do you think we find simplicity

07:58.440 --> 08:00.000
 so appealing as human beings?

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
 Why does E equals MC squared seem so beautiful to us humans?

08:05.000 --> 08:08.480
 I guess mostly, in general, many things

08:08.480 --> 08:12.000
 can be explained by an evolutionary argument.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.240
 And there's some artifacts in humans

08:14.240 --> 08:18.240
 which are just artifacts and not evolutionary necessary.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.120
 But with this beauty and simplicity,

08:21.120 --> 08:26.120
 it's, I believe, at least the core is about,

08:28.160 --> 08:31.520
 like science, finding regularities in the world,

08:31.520 --> 08:35.120
 understanding the world, which is necessary for survival.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.480
 If I look at a bush and I just see noise,

08:39.480 --> 08:42.080
 and there is a tiger and it eats me, then I'm dead.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.000
 But if I try to find a pattern,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
 and we know that humans are prone to find more patterns

08:49.360 --> 08:53.160
 in data than they are, like the Mars face

08:53.160 --> 08:55.680
 and all these things, but these biads

08:55.680 --> 08:58.240
 towards finding patterns, even if they are non,

08:58.240 --> 09:01.360
 but, I mean, it's best, of course, if they are, yeah,

09:01.360 --> 09:02.640
 helps us for survival.

09:04.040 --> 09:04.880
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.240
 I haven't thought really about the,

09:07.240 --> 09:08.840
 I thought I just loved science,

09:08.840 --> 09:13.600
 but indeed, in terms of just for survival purposes,

09:13.600 --> 09:15.920
 there is an evolutionary argument

09:15.920 --> 09:20.600
 for why we find the work of Einstein so beautiful.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.080
 Maybe a quick small tangent.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.040
 Could you describe what's,

09:26.040 --> 09:28.400
 Salomonov induction is?

09:28.400 --> 09:32.680
 Yeah, so that's a theory which I claim,

09:32.680 --> 09:35.440
 and Mr. Lomanov sort of claimed a long time ago,

09:35.440 --> 09:39.800
 that this solves the big philosophical problem of induction.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.760
 And I believe the claim is essentially true.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.800
 And what it does is the following.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.640
 So, okay, for the picky listener,

09:49.640 --> 09:53.560
 induction can be interpreted narrowly and widely.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.160
 Narrow means inferring models from data.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.240
 And widely means also then using these models

10:01.240 --> 10:02.320
 for doing predictions,

10:02.320 --> 10:04.760
 so predictions also part of the induction.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.680
 So I'm a little bit sloppy sort of with the terminology,

10:07.680 --> 10:10.880
 and maybe that comes from Ray Salomonov, you know,

10:10.880 --> 10:12.800
 being sloppy, maybe I shouldn't say that.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.640
 He can't complain anymore.

10:15.640 --> 10:20.240
 So let me explain a little bit this theory in simple terms.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.960
 So assume you have a data sequence,

10:21.960 --> 10:24.800
 make it very simple, the simplest one say 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

10:24.800 --> 10:28.840
 and you see if 100 ones, what do you think comes next?

10:28.840 --> 10:30.560
 The natural answer, I'm gonna speed up a little bit,

10:30.560 --> 10:33.640
 the natural answer is of course, you know, one, okay?

10:33.640 --> 10:36.040
 And the question is why, okay?

10:36.040 --> 10:38.920
 Well, we see a pattern there, yeah, okay,

10:38.920 --> 10:40.720
 there's a one and we repeat it.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.440
 And why should it suddenly after 100 ones be different?

10:43.440 --> 10:47.040
 So what we're looking for is simple explanations or models

10:47.040 --> 10:48.640
 for the data we have.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.800
 And now the question is,

10:49.800 --> 10:53.400
 a model has to be presented in a certain language,

10:53.400 --> 10:55.440
 in which language do we use?

10:55.440 --> 10:57.480
 In science, we want formal languages,

10:57.480 --> 10:58.840
 and we can use mathematics,

10:58.840 --> 11:01.920
 or we can use programs on a computer.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.480
 So abstractly on a Turing machine, for instance,

11:04.480 --> 11:06.320
 or it can be a general purpose computer.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.320
 So, and there are of course, lots of models of,

11:09.320 --> 11:11.880
 you can say maybe it's 100 ones and then 100 zeros

11:11.880 --> 11:13.320
 and 100 ones, that's a model, right?

11:13.320 --> 11:17.240
 But there are simpler models, there's a model print one loop,

11:17.240 --> 11:19.840
 and it also explains the data.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.120
 And if you push that to the extreme,

11:23.120 --> 11:25.320
 you are looking for the shortest program,

11:25.320 --> 11:29.400
 which if you run this program reproduces the data you have,

11:29.400 --> 11:32.280
 it will not stop, it will continue naturally.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.600
 And this you take for your prediction.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.040
 And on the sequence of ones, it's very plausible, right?

11:37.040 --> 11:39.400
 That print one loop is the shortest program.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.480
 We can give some more complex examples

11:41.480 --> 11:43.760
 like one, two, three, four, five.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.600
 What comes next?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.240
 The short program is again, you know,

11:46.240 --> 11:50.160
 counter, and so that is roughly speaking

11:50.160 --> 11:51.800
 how solomotive induction works.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.360
 The extra twist is that it can also deal with noisy data.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.680
 So if you have, for instance, a coin flip,

11:58.680 --> 12:02.040
 say a biased coin, which comes up head with 60% probability,

12:03.320 --> 12:06.520
 then it will predict, it will learn and figure this out,

12:06.520 --> 12:09.480
 and after a while it predicts, oh, the next coin flip

12:09.480 --> 12:11.400
 will be head with probability 60%.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.480
 So it's the stochastic version of that.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.440
 But the goal is, the dream is always the search

12:16.440 --> 12:17.520
 for the short program.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.360
 Yes, yeah.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.000
 Well, in solomotive induction, precisely what you do is,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.840
 so you combine, so looking for the shortest program

12:24.840 --> 12:26.520
 is like applying Opaque's razor,

12:26.520 --> 12:28.480
 like looking for the simplest theory.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.160
 There's also Epicorus principle, which says,

12:31.160 --> 12:32.720
 if you have multiple hypotheses,

12:32.720 --> 12:34.440
 which equally well describe your data,

12:34.440 --> 12:36.520
 don't discard any of them, keep all of them around,

12:36.520 --> 12:37.920
 you never know.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.680
 And you can put that together and say,

12:39.680 --> 12:42.080
 okay, I have a bias towards simplicity,

12:42.080 --> 12:44.280
 but it don't rule out the larger models.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.360
 And technically what we do is,

12:46.360 --> 12:49.880
 we weigh the shorter models higher

12:49.880 --> 12:52.040
 and the longer models lower.

12:52.040 --> 12:55.280
 And you use a Bayesian techniques, you have a prior,

12:55.280 --> 12:59.520
 and which is precisely two to the minus

12:59.520 --> 13:01.840
 the complexity of the program.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.440
 And you weigh all this hypothesis and take this mixture,

13:04.440 --> 13:06.840
 and then you get also the stochasticity in.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.200
 Yeah, like many of your ideas,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.560
 that's just a beautiful idea of weighing based

13:10.560 --> 13:12.280
 on the simplicity of the program.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.480
 I love that, that seems to me

13:15.480 --> 13:17.200
 maybe a very human centric concept.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.440
 It seems to be a very appealing way

13:19.440 --> 13:23.560
 of discovering good programs in this world.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.760
 You've used the term compression quite a bit.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.240
 I think it's a beautiful idea.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.600
 Sort of, we just talked about simplicity

13:32.600 --> 13:37.280
 and maybe science or just all of our intellectual pursuits

13:37.280 --> 13:41.040
 is basically the time to compress the complexity

13:41.040 --> 13:43.080
 all around us into something simple.

13:43.080 --> 13:48.080
 So what does this word mean to you, compression?

13:49.920 --> 13:51.560
 I essentially have already explained it.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.960
 So it compression means for me,

13:53.960 --> 13:58.400
 finding short programs for the data

13:58.400 --> 13:59.760
 or the phenomenon at hand.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.640
 You could interpret it more widely,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.960
 finding simple theories,

14:03.960 --> 14:05.440
 which can be mathematical theories

14:05.440 --> 14:09.040
 or maybe even informal, like just in words.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.920
 Compression means finding short descriptions,

14:11.920 --> 14:14.880
 explanations, programs for the data.

14:14.880 --> 14:19.880
 Do you see science as a kind of our human attempt

14:20.320 --> 14:23.040
 at compression, so we're speaking more generally,

14:23.040 --> 14:24.920
 because when you say programs,

14:24.920 --> 14:26.800
 you're kind of zooming in on a particular sort of

14:26.800 --> 14:28.080
 almost like a computer science,

14:28.080 --> 14:30.200
 artificial intelligence focus,

14:30.200 --> 14:31.920
 but do you see all of human endeavor

14:31.920 --> 14:34.360
 as a kind of compression?

14:34.360 --> 14:35.560
 Well, at least all of science,

14:35.560 --> 14:37.600
 I see as an endeavor of compression,

14:37.600 --> 14:39.680
 not all of humanity, maybe.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.160
 And well, there are also some other aspects of science

14:42.160 --> 14:43.600
 like experimental design, right?

14:43.600 --> 14:47.440
 I mean, we create experiments specifically

14:47.440 --> 14:48.720
 to get extra knowledge.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.320
 And that isn't part of the decision making process,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.400
 but once we have the data,

14:55.400 --> 14:58.160
 to understand the data is essentially compression.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.800
 So I don't see any difference between compression,

15:00.800 --> 15:05.040
 compression, understanding, and prediction.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.960
 So we're jumping around topics a little bit,

15:07.960 --> 15:10.480
 but returning back to simplicity,

15:10.480 --> 15:14.320
 a fascinating concept of Kolmogorov complexity.

15:14.320 --> 15:17.120
 So in your sense, do most objects

15:17.120 --> 15:19.680
 in our mathematical universe

15:19.680 --> 15:21.960
 have high Kolmogorov complexity?

15:21.960 --> 15:24.080
 And maybe what is, first of all,

15:24.080 --> 15:25.960
 what is Kolmogorov complexity?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.400
 Okay, Kolmogorov complexity is a notion

15:28.400 --> 15:31.160
 of simplicity or complexity,

15:31.160 --> 15:35.960
 and it takes the compression view to the extreme.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.680
 So I explained before that if you have some data sequence,

15:39.680 --> 15:41.720
 just think about a file in a computer

15:41.720 --> 15:45.120
 and best sort of, you know, just a string of bits.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.440
 And if you, and we have data compressors,

15:49.440 --> 15:52.040
 like we compress big files into zip files

15:52.040 --> 15:53.720
 with certain compressors.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.360
 And you can also produce self extracting ArcaFs.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.000
 That means as an executable,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.760
 if you run it, it reproduces your original file

16:00.760 --> 16:02.880
 without needing an extra decompressor.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.240
 It's just a decompressor plus the ArcaF together in one.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.840
 And now there are better and worse compressors,

16:08.840 --> 16:11.120
 and you can ask, what is the ultimate compressor?

16:11.120 --> 16:14.880
 So what is the shortest possible self extracting ArcaF

16:14.880 --> 16:17.920
 you could produce for a certain data set here,

16:17.920 --> 16:19.560
 which reproduces the data set.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.320
 And the length of this is called the Kolmogorov complexity.

16:23.320 --> 16:26.680
 And arguably that is the information content

16:26.680 --> 16:27.960
 in the data set.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.480
 I mean, if the data set is very redundant or very boring,

16:30.480 --> 16:31.760
 you can compress it very well.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.760
 So the information content should be low

16:34.760 --> 16:36.920
 and you know, it is low according to this definition.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.720
 So it's the length of the shortest program

16:39.720 --> 16:41.040
 that summarizes the data?

16:41.040 --> 16:42.040
 Yes.

16:42.040 --> 16:46.280
 And what's your sense of our sort of universe

16:46.280 --> 16:51.280
 when we think about the different objects in our universe

16:51.360 --> 16:55.440
 that we try, concepts or whatever at every level,

16:55.440 --> 16:58.320
 do they have higher or low Kolmogorov complexity?

16:58.320 --> 16:59.400
 So what's the hope?

17:00.280 --> 17:01.400
 Do we have a lot of hope

17:01.400 --> 17:04.400
 and be able to summarize much of our world?

17:05.680 --> 17:08.520
 That's a tricky and difficult question.

17:08.520 --> 17:13.520
 So as I said before, I believe that the whole universe

17:13.560 --> 17:16.760
 based on the evidence we have is very simple.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.240
 So it has a very short description.

17:19.240 --> 17:23.200
 Sorry, to linger on that, the whole universe,

17:23.200 --> 17:24.040
 what does that mean?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.720
 You mean at the very basic fundamental level

17:26.720 --> 17:28.560
 in order to create the universe?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.400
 Yes, yeah.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.960
 So you need a very short program and you run it.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.040
 To get the thing going.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.040
 To get the thing going

17:35.040 --> 17:37.480
 and then it will reproduce our universe.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.320
 There's a problem with noise.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.080
 We can come back to that later possibly.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.240
 Is noise a problem or is it a bug or a feature?

17:46.240 --> 17:49.440
 I would say it makes our life as a scientist

17:49.440 --> 17:52.160
 really, really much harder.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.480
 I mean, think about without noise,

17:53.480 --> 17:55.920
 we wouldn't need all of the statistics.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.840
 But then maybe we wouldn't feel like there's a free will.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.360
 Maybe we need that for the...

18:01.360 --> 18:04.000
 This is an illusion that noise can give you free will.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.640
 At least in that way, it's a feature.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.000
 But also, if you don't have noise,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.720
 you have chaotic phenomena,

18:10.720 --> 18:12.720
 which are effectively like noise.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.680
 So we can't get away with statistics even then.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.520
 I mean, think about rolling a dice

18:17.520 --> 18:19.200
 and forget about quantum mechanics

18:19.200 --> 18:21.160
 and you know exactly how you throw it.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.000
 But I mean, it's still so hard to compute the trajectory

18:24.000 --> 18:26.400
 that effectively it is best to model it

18:26.400 --> 18:30.080
 as coming out with a number,

18:30.080 --> 18:31.640
 this probability one over six.

18:33.040 --> 18:36.320
 But from this set of philosophical

18:36.320 --> 18:38.080
 Kolmogorov complexity perspective,

18:38.080 --> 18:39.880
 if we didn't have noise,

18:39.880 --> 18:43.160
 then arguably you could describe the whole universe

18:43.160 --> 18:47.400
 as well as a standard model plus generativity.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.600
 I mean, we don't have a theory of everything yet,

18:49.600 --> 18:52.200
 but sort of assuming we are close to it or have it.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.400
 Plus the initial conditions, which may hopefully be simple.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.600
 And then you just run it

18:56.600 --> 18:59.040
 and then you would reproduce the universe.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.520
 But that's spoiled by noise or by chaotic systems

19:03.520 --> 19:06.280
 or by initial conditions, which may be complex.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.680
 So now if we don't take the whole universe,

19:09.680 --> 19:13.720
 but just a subset, just take planet Earth.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.600
 Planet Earth cannot be compressed

19:15.600 --> 19:17.520
 into a couple of equations.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.200
 This is a hugely complex system.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.040
 So interesting.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.640
 So when you look at the window,

19:21.640 --> 19:23.000
 like the whole thing might be simple,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.080
 but when you just take a small window, then...

19:26.080 --> 19:28.760
 It may become complex and that may be counterintuitive,

19:28.760 --> 19:31.720
 but there's a very nice analogy.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.240
 The book, the library of all books.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.960
 So imagine you have a normal library with interesting books

19:36.960 --> 19:39.320
 and you go there, great, lots of information

19:39.320 --> 19:41.960
 and quite complex.

19:41.960 --> 19:45.000
 So now I create a library which contains all possible books,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.800
 say of 500 pages.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.680
 So the first book just has A, A, A, A, A over all the pages.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.240
 The next book A, A, A and ends with B and so on.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.200
 I create this library of all books.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.280
 I can write a super short program which creates this library.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.000
 So this library which has all books

19:59.000 --> 20:01.280
 has zero information content.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.880
 And you take a subset of this library

20:02.880 --> 20:05.320
 and suddenly you have a lot of information in there.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.680
 So that's fascinating.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.320
 I think one of the most beautiful object,

20:08.320 --> 20:10.440
 mathematical objects that at least today

20:10.440 --> 20:12.520
 seems to be understudied or under talked about

20:12.520 --> 20:14.920
 is cellular automata.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.560
 What lessons do you draw from sort of the game of life

20:18.560 --> 20:20.800
 for cellular automata where you start with the simple rules

20:20.800 --> 20:22.840
 just like you're describing with the universe

20:22.840 --> 20:26.280
 and somehow complexity emerges.

20:26.280 --> 20:30.400
 Do you feel like you have an intuitive grasp

20:30.400 --> 20:34.120
 on the fascinating behavior of such systems

20:34.120 --> 20:37.560
 where like you said, some chaotic behavior could happen,

20:37.560 --> 20:39.560
 some complexity could emerge,

20:39.560 --> 20:43.680
 some it could die out and some very rigid structures.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.760
 Do you have a sense about cellular automata

20:46.760 --> 20:48.200
 that somehow transfers maybe

20:48.200 --> 20:50.960
 to the bigger questions of our universe?

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
 Yeah, the cellular automata

20:51.960 --> 20:54.240
 and especially the Conway's game of life

20:54.240 --> 20:56.240
 is really great because these rules are so simple.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.720
 You can explain it to every child

20:57.720 --> 21:00.280
 and even by hand you can simulate a little bit

21:00.280 --> 21:04.040
 and you see these beautiful patterns emerge

21:04.040 --> 21:06.800
 and people have proven that it's even Turing complete.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.840
 You cannot just use a computer to simulate game of life

21:09.840 --> 21:13.480
 but you can also use game of life to simulate any computer.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.520
 That is truly amazing.

21:16.520 --> 21:21.240
 And it's the prime example probably to demonstrate

21:21.240 --> 21:25.040
 that very simple rules can lead to very rich phenomena.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.840
 And people sometimes,

21:26.840 --> 21:29.720
 how is chemistry and biology so rich?

21:29.720 --> 21:32.400
 I mean, this can't be based on simple rules.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.520
 But no, we know quantum electrodynamics

21:34.520 --> 21:36.360
 describes all of chemistry.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.960
 And we come later back to that.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.960
 I claim intelligence can be explained

21:40.960 --> 21:43.000
 or described in one single equation.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.600
 This very rich phenomenon.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.880
 You asked also about whether I understand this phenomenon

21:49.880 --> 21:53.240
 and it's probably not.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.560
 And there's this saying,

21:55.560 --> 21:56.800
 you never understand really things,

21:56.800 --> 21:58.360
 you just get used to them.

21:58.360 --> 22:03.360
 And I think I got pretty used to cellular automata.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.440
 So you believe that you understand

22:05.440 --> 22:07.120
 now why this phenomenon happens.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.240
 But I give you a different example.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.760
 I didn't play too much with Conway's game of life

22:11.760 --> 22:15.000
 but a little bit more with fractals

22:15.000 --> 22:18.480
 and with the Mandelbrot set and these beautiful patterns,

22:18.480 --> 22:19.960
 just look Mandelbrot set.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.280
 And well, when the computers were really slow

22:23.280 --> 22:25.280
 and I just had a black and white monitor

22:25.280 --> 22:29.040
 and programmed my own programs in assembler too.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.920
 Assembler, wow.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.360
 Wow, you're legit.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.480
 To get these fractals on the screen

22:35.480 --> 22:37.320
 and it was mesmerized and much later.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.080
 So I returned to this every couple of years

22:40.080 --> 22:42.800
 and then I tried to understand what is going on.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.800
 And you can understand a little bit.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.720
 So I tried to derive the locations,

22:48.720 --> 22:53.520
 there are these circles and the apple shape

22:53.520 --> 22:57.360
 and then you have smaller Mandelbrot sets

22:57.360 --> 22:59.000
 recursively in this set.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.720
 And there's a way to mathematically

23:01.720 --> 23:03.480
 by solving high order polynomials

23:03.480 --> 23:05.640
 to figure out where these centers are

23:05.640 --> 23:08.080
 and what size they are approximately.

23:08.080 --> 23:12.560
 And by sort of mathematically approaching this problem,

23:12.560 --> 23:17.560
 you slowly get a feeling of why things are like they are

23:18.080 --> 23:20.760
 and that sort of isn't, you know,

23:21.960 --> 23:24.880
 first step to understanding why this rich phenomena.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.200
 Do you think it's possible, what's your intuition?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.880
 Do you think it's possible to reverse engineer

23:28.880 --> 23:33.320
 and find the short program that generated these fractals

23:33.320 --> 23:36.400
 sort of by looking at the fractals?

23:36.400 --> 23:38.840
 Well, in principle, yes, yeah.

23:38.840 --> 23:42.000
 So, I mean, in principle, what you can do is

23:42.000 --> 23:43.480
 you take, you know, any data set, you know,

23:43.480 --> 23:46.480
 you take these fractals or you take whatever your data set,

23:46.480 --> 23:51.000
 whatever you have, say a picture of Convey's Game of Life

23:51.000 --> 23:53.200
 and you run through all programs.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.280
 You take a program size one, two, three, four

23:55.280 --> 23:57.080
 and all these programs around them all in parallel

23:57.080 --> 23:59.080
 in so called dovetailing fashion,

23:59.080 --> 24:01.320
 give them computational resources,

24:01.320 --> 24:03.880
 first one 50%, second one half resources and so on

24:03.880 --> 24:06.960
 and let them run, wait until they halt,

24:06.960 --> 24:09.120
 give an output, compare it to your data

24:09.120 --> 24:12.360
 and if some of these programs produce the correct data,

24:12.360 --> 24:14.480
 then you stop and then you have already some program.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.680
 It may be a long program because it's faster

24:16.680 --> 24:18.760
 and then you continue and you get shorter

24:18.760 --> 24:20.760
 and shorter programs until you eventually

24:20.760 --> 24:22.520
 find the shortest program.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.040
 The interesting thing, you can never know

24:24.040 --> 24:25.520
 whether it's the shortest program

24:25.520 --> 24:27.440
 because there could be an even shorter program

24:27.440 --> 24:32.200
 which is just even slower and you just have to wait here.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.000
 But asymptotically and actually after a finite time,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.480
 you have the shortest program.

24:36.480 --> 24:40.440
 So this is a theoretical but completely impractical way

24:40.440 --> 24:45.440
 of finding the underlying structure in every data set

24:47.440 --> 24:49.040
 and that is what Solomov induction does

24:49.040 --> 24:50.680
 and Kolmogorov complexity.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.680
 In practice, of course, we have to approach the problem

24:52.680 --> 24:53.760
 more intelligently.

24:53.760 --> 24:58.760
 And then if you take resource limitations into account,

24:58.760 --> 25:01.760
 there's, for instance, a field of pseudo random numbers

25:01.760 --> 25:06.760
 and these are deterministic sequences,

25:06.760 --> 25:09.120
 but no algorithm which is fast,

25:09.120 --> 25:10.800
 fast means runs in polynomial time,

25:10.800 --> 25:13.800
 can detect that it's actually deterministic.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.040
 So we can produce interesting,

25:16.040 --> 25:17.680
 I mean, random numbers maybe not that interesting,

25:17.680 --> 25:18.520
 but just an example.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.480
 We can produce complex looking data

25:22.480 --> 25:25.280
 and we can then prove that no fast algorithm

25:25.280 --> 25:27.440
 can detect the underlying pattern.

25:27.440 --> 25:32.440
 Which is, unfortunately, that's a big challenge

25:34.240 --> 25:35.920
 for our search for simple programs

25:35.920 --> 25:38.440
 in the space of artificial intelligence, perhaps.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.480
 Yes, it definitely is for artificial intelligence

25:40.480 --> 25:44.520
 and it's quite surprising that it's, I can't say easy.

25:44.520 --> 25:48.240
 I mean, physicists worked really hard to find these theories,

25:48.240 --> 25:51.920
 but apparently it was possible for human minds

25:51.920 --> 25:54.040
 to find these simple rules in the universe.

25:54.040 --> 25:59.200
 It could have been different, right?

25:59.200 --> 26:00.200
 It could have been different.

26:00.200 --> 26:04.720
 It's awe inspiring.

26:04.720 --> 26:09.120
 So let me ask another absurdly big question.

26:09.120 --> 26:13.280
 What is intelligence in your view?

26:13.280 --> 26:17.080
 So I have, of course, a definition.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.240
 I wasn't sure what you're going to say

26:18.240 --> 26:20.000
 because you could have just as easily said,

26:20.000 --> 26:21.520
 I have no clue.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.360
 Which many people would say,

26:23.360 --> 26:26.680
 but I'm not modest in this question.

26:26.680 --> 26:31.440
 So the informal version,

26:31.440 --> 26:33.120
 which I worked out together with Shane Lack,

26:33.120 --> 26:35.520
 who cofounded DeepMind,

26:35.520 --> 26:38.720
 is that intelligence measures an agent's ability

26:38.720 --> 26:42.880
 to perform well in a wide range of environments.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.800
 So that doesn't sound very impressive.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.560
 And these words have been very carefully chosen

26:49.560 --> 26:52.960
 and there is a mathematical theory behind that

26:52.960 --> 26:54.920
 and we come back to that later.

26:54.920 --> 26:59.640
 And if you look at this definition by itself,

26:59.640 --> 27:01.160
 it seems like, yeah, okay,

27:01.160 --> 27:03.400
 but it seems a lot of things are missing.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.000
 But if you think it through,

27:05.920 --> 27:08.760
 then you realize that most,

27:08.760 --> 27:10.680
 and I claim all of the other traits,

27:10.680 --> 27:12.600
 at least of rational intelligence,

27:12.600 --> 27:14.440
 which we usually associate with intelligence,

27:14.440 --> 27:17.960
 are emergent phenomena from this definition.

27:17.960 --> 27:22.160
 Like creativity, memorization, planning, knowledge.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.000
 You all need that in order to perform well

27:25.000 --> 27:27.400
 in a wide range of environments.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.000
 So you don't have to explicitly mention

27:29.000 --> 27:29.960
 that in a definition.

27:29.960 --> 27:30.800
 Interesting.

27:30.800 --> 27:34.040
 So yeah, so the consciousness, abstract reasoning,

27:34.040 --> 27:36.200
 all these kinds of things are just emergent phenomena

27:36.200 --> 27:39.640
 that help you in towards,

27:40.640 --> 27:41.880
 can you say the definition again?

27:41.880 --> 27:44.160
 So multiple environments.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.880
 Did you mention the word goals?

27:45.880 --> 27:47.760
 No, but we have an alternative definition.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.800
 Instead of performing well,

27:48.800 --> 27:50.160
 you can just replace it by goals.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.280
 So intelligence measures an agent's ability

27:53.280 --> 27:55.680
 to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.520
 That's more or less equal.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.360
 But interesting,

27:57.360 --> 27:59.680
 because in there, there's an injection of the word goals.

27:59.680 --> 28:03.160
 So we want to specify there should be a goal.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.800
 Yeah, but perform well is sort of,

28:04.800 --> 28:05.760
 what does it mean?

28:05.760 --> 28:06.640
 It's the same problem.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.760
 Yeah.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.240
 There's a little bit gray area,

28:09.240 --> 28:12.280
 but it's much closer to something that could be formalized.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.320
 In your view, are humans,

28:16.320 --> 28:18.320
 where do humans fit into that definition?

28:18.320 --> 28:21.920
 Are they general intelligence systems

28:21.920 --> 28:24.120
 that are able to perform in,

28:24.120 --> 28:27.840
 like how good are they at fulfilling that definition

28:27.840 --> 28:31.200
 at performing well in multiple environments?

28:31.200 --> 28:32.760
 Yeah, that's a big question.

28:32.760 --> 28:37.640
 I mean, the humans are performing best among all species.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.680
 We know of, yeah.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.520
 Depends.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.440
 You could say that trees and plants are doing a better job.

28:44.440 --> 28:46.280
 They'll probably outlast us.

28:46.280 --> 28:49.400
 Yeah, but they are in a much more narrow environment, right?

28:49.400 --> 28:51.680
 I mean, you just have a little bit of air pollutions

28:51.680 --> 28:54.040
 and these trees die and we can adapt, right?

28:54.040 --> 28:55.440
 We build houses, we build filters,

28:55.440 --> 28:59.480
 we do geoengineering.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.040
 So the multiple environment part.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.600
 Yeah, that is very important, yeah.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.640
 So that distinguish narrow intelligence

29:04.640 --> 29:07.320
 from wide intelligence, also in the AI research.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.080
 So let me ask the Allentourian question.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.160
 Can machines think?

29:14.160 --> 29:15.880
 Can machines be intelligent?

29:15.880 --> 29:19.560
 So in your view, I have to kind of ask,

29:19.560 --> 29:20.560
 the answer is probably yes,

29:20.560 --> 29:24.360
 but I want to kind of hear what your thoughts on it.

29:24.360 --> 29:27.720
 Can machines be made to fulfill this definition

29:27.720 --> 29:30.760
 of intelligence, to achieve intelligence?

29:30.760 --> 29:33.000
 Well, we are sort of getting there

29:33.000 --> 29:35.840
 and on a small scale, we are already there.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.960
 The wide range of environments are missing,

29:38.960 --> 29:40.320
 but we have self driving cars,

29:40.320 --> 29:42.720
 we have programs which play Go and chess,

29:42.720 --> 29:44.440
 we have speech recognition.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.480
 So that's pretty amazing,

29:45.480 --> 29:48.400
 but these are narrow environments.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.000
 But if you look at AlphaZero,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.720
 that was also developed by DeepMind.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.400
 I mean, got famous with AlphaGo

29:55.400 --> 29:57.720
 and then came AlphaZero a year later.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.280
 That was truly amazing.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.800
 So reinforcement learning algorithm,

30:01.800 --> 30:04.440
 which is able just by self play,

30:04.440 --> 30:08.560
 to play chess and then also Go.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.120
 And I mean, yes, they're both games,

30:10.120 --> 30:11.400
 but they're quite different games.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.120
 And you didn't don't feed them the rules of the game.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.720
 And the most remarkable thing,

30:16.720 --> 30:18.080
 which is still a mystery to me,

30:18.080 --> 30:21.040
 that usually for any decent chess program,

30:21.040 --> 30:22.800
 I don't know much about Go,

30:22.800 --> 30:26.960
 you need opening books and end game tables and so on too.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.680
 And nothing in there, nothing was put in there.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.360
 Especially with AlphaZero,

30:31.360 --> 30:33.520
 the self playing mechanism starting from scratch,

30:33.520 --> 30:38.520
 being able to learn actually new strategies is...

30:39.040 --> 30:43.040
 Yeah, it rediscovered all these famous openings

30:43.040 --> 30:46.280
 within four hours by itself.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.480
 What I was really happy about,

30:47.480 --> 30:50.200
 I'm a terrible chess player, but I like Queen Gumby.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.160
 And AlphaZero figured out that this is the best opening.

30:53.160 --> 30:58.160
 Finally, somebody proved you correct.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.680
 So yes, to answer your question,

31:01.680 --> 31:05.040
 yes, I believe that general intelligence is possible.

31:05.040 --> 31:08.280
 And it also, I mean, it depends how you define it.

31:08.280 --> 31:11.520
 Do you say AGI with general intelligence,

31:11.520 --> 31:13.600
 artificial intelligence,

31:13.600 --> 31:16.120
 only refers to if you achieve human level

31:16.120 --> 31:18.600
 or a subhuman level, but quite broad,

31:18.600 --> 31:19.960
 is it also general intelligence?

31:19.960 --> 31:20.920
 So we have to distinguish,

31:20.920 --> 31:23.360
 or it's only super human intelligence,

31:23.360 --> 31:25.120
 general artificial intelligence.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.680
 Is there a test in your mind,

31:26.680 --> 31:28.680
 like the Turing test for natural language

31:28.680 --> 31:32.000
 or some other test that would impress the heck out of you

31:32.000 --> 31:36.960
 that would kind of cross the line of your sense

31:36.960 --> 31:39.840
 of intelligence within the framework that you said?

31:39.840 --> 31:42.960
 Well, the Turing test has been criticized a lot,

31:42.960 --> 31:45.880
 but I think it's not as bad as some people think.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.680
 And some people think it's too strong.

31:47.680 --> 31:52.120
 So it tests not just for system to be intelligent,

31:52.120 --> 31:56.960
 but it also has to fake human deception,

31:56.960 --> 31:58.960
 which is much harder.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.160
 And on the other hand, they say it's too weak

32:01.160 --> 32:05.640
 because it just maybe fakes emotions

32:05.640 --> 32:07.680
 or intelligent behavior.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.400
 It's not real.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.960
 But I don't think that's the problem or a big problem.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.480
 So if you would pass the Turing test,

32:15.720 --> 32:20.600
 so a conversation over terminal with a bot for an hour,

32:20.600 --> 32:21.760
 or maybe a day or so,

32:21.760 --> 32:25.080
 and you can fool a human into not knowing

32:25.080 --> 32:26.120
 whether this is a human or not,

32:26.120 --> 32:27.720
 so that's the Turing test,

32:27.720 --> 32:30.240
 I would be truly impressed.

32:30.240 --> 32:34.360
 And we have this annual competition, the Lübner Prize.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.960
 And I mean, it started with ELISA,

32:35.960 --> 32:38.200
 that was the first conversational program.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.200
 And what is it called?

32:40.200 --> 32:41.760
 The Japanese Mitsuko or so.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.680
 That's the winner of the last couple of years.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.520
 And well.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.360
 Quite impressive.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.200
 Yeah, it's quite impressive.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.240
 And then Google has developed Mina, right?

32:50.240 --> 32:55.200
 Just recently, that's an open domain conversational bot,

32:55.200 --> 32:57.560
 just a couple of weeks ago, I think.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.760
 Yeah, I kind of like the metric

32:58.760 --> 33:01.680
 that sort of the Alexa Prize has proposed.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.880
 I mean, maybe it's obvious to you.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.400
 It wasn't to me of setting sort of a length

33:06.400 --> 33:07.720
 of a conversation.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.920
 Like you want the bot to be sufficiently interesting

33:10.920 --> 33:12.360
 that you would want to keep talking to it

33:12.360 --> 33:13.640
 for like 20 minutes.

33:13.640 --> 33:18.640
 And that's a surprisingly effective in aggregate metric,

33:19.520 --> 33:24.520
 because really, like nobody has the patience

33:24.960 --> 33:27.720
 to be able to talk to a bot that's not interesting

33:27.720 --> 33:29.000
 and intelligent and witty,

33:29.000 --> 33:32.960
 and is able to go on to different tangents, jump domains,

33:32.960 --> 33:35.360
 be able to say something interesting

33:35.360 --> 33:36.680
 to maintain your attention.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.040
 And maybe many humans will also fail this test.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.840
 That's the, unfortunately, we set,

33:42.840 --> 33:45.400
 just like with autonomous vehicles, with chatbots,

33:45.400 --> 33:48.200
 we also set a bar that's way too high to reach.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.000
 I said, you know, the Turing test is not as bad

33:50.000 --> 33:51.160
 as some people believe,

33:51.160 --> 33:55.920
 but what is really not useful about the Turing test,

33:55.920 --> 33:58.160
 it gives us no guidance

33:58.160 --> 34:00.560
 how to develop these systems in the first place.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.960
 Of course, you know, we can develop them by trial and error

34:02.960 --> 34:05.400
 and, you know, do whatever and then run the test

34:05.400 --> 34:06.880
 and see whether it works or not.

34:06.880 --> 34:11.880
 But a mathematical definition of intelligence

34:12.320 --> 34:16.200
 gives us, you know, an objective,

34:16.200 --> 34:19.520
 which we can then analyze by theoretical tools

34:19.520 --> 34:22.480
 or computational, and, you know,

34:22.480 --> 34:25.160
 maybe even prove how close we are.

34:25.160 --> 34:28.760
 And we will come back to that later with the iXe model.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.280
 So, I mentioned the compression, right?

34:31.280 --> 34:33.320
 So in natural language processing,

34:33.320 --> 34:36.760
 they have achieved amazing results.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.760
 And one way to test this, of course,

34:38.760 --> 34:40.280
 you know, take the system, you train it,

34:40.280 --> 34:43.200
 and then you see how well it performs on the task.

34:43.200 --> 34:47.520
 But a lot of performance measurement

34:47.520 --> 34:49.040
 is done by so called perplexity,

34:49.040 --> 34:51.920
 which is essentially the same as complexity

34:51.920 --> 34:53.240
 or compression length.

34:53.240 --> 34:55.920
 So the NLP community develops new systems

34:55.920 --> 34:57.520
 and then they measure the compression length

34:57.520 --> 35:01.280
 and then they have ranking and leaks

35:01.280 --> 35:02.800
 because there's a strong correlation

35:02.800 --> 35:04.640
 between compressing well,

35:04.640 --> 35:07.560
 and then the system's performing well at the task at hand.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.840
 It's not perfect, but it's good enough

35:09.840 --> 35:13.680
 for them as an intermediate aim.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.040
 So you mean a measure,

35:16.040 --> 35:18.400
 so this is kind of almost returning

35:18.400 --> 35:19.800
 to the common goal of complexity.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.520
 So you're saying good compression

35:22.520 --> 35:24.960
 usually means good intelligence.

35:24.960 --> 35:25.800
 Yes.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.120
 So you mentioned you're one of the only people

35:31.120 --> 35:36.120
 who dared boldly to try to formalize

35:36.280 --> 35:38.720
 the idea of artificial general intelligence,

35:38.720 --> 35:42.840
 to have a mathematical framework for intelligence,

35:42.840 --> 35:44.120
 just like as we mentioned,

35:45.000 --> 35:49.200
 termed AIXI, A, I, X, I.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.760
 So let me ask the basic question.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.400
 What is AIXI?

35:54.760 --> 35:57.960
 Okay, so let me first say what it stands for because...

35:57.960 --> 35:58.880
 What it stands for, actually,

35:58.880 --> 36:00.360
 that's probably the more basic question.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.640
 What it...

36:01.640 --> 36:04.400
 The first question is usually how it's pronounced,

36:04.400 --> 36:07.240
 but finally I put it on the website how it's pronounced

36:07.240 --> 36:08.400
 and you figured it out.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.280
 The name comes from AI, artificial intelligence,

36:13.280 --> 36:16.400
 and the X, I, is the Greek letter Xi,

36:16.400 --> 36:19.680
 which are used for Solomonov's distribution

36:19.680 --> 36:22.000
 for quite stupid reasons,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.800
 which I'm not willing to repeat here in front of camera.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.640
 Sure.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.840
 So it just happened to be more or less arbitrary.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.600
 I chose the Xi.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.680
 But it also has nice other interpretations.

36:34.680 --> 36:38.360
 So there are actions and perceptions in this model.

36:38.360 --> 36:42.000
 An agent has actions and perceptions over time.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.680
 So this is A index I, X index I.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.120
 So there's the action at time I

36:46.120 --> 36:49.040
 and then followed by perception at time I.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.440
 Yeah, we'll go with that.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.320
 I'll edit out the first part.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.320
 I'm just kidding.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.120
 I have some more interpretations.

36:55.120 --> 36:59.280
 So at some point, maybe five years ago or 10 years ago,

36:59.280 --> 37:04.280
 I discovered in Barcelona, it was on a big church

37:04.720 --> 37:08.480
 that was in stone engraved, some text,

37:08.480 --> 37:11.480
 and the word Aixia appeared there a couple of times.

37:11.480 --> 37:16.480
 I was very surprised and happy about that.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.800
 And I looked it up.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.440
 So it is a Catalan language

37:19.440 --> 37:22.280
 and it means with some interpretation of that's it,

37:22.280 --> 37:23.320
 that's the right thing to do.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.800
 Yeah, Huayrica.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.920
 Oh, so it's almost like destined somehow.

37:27.920 --> 37:32.080
 It came to you in a dream.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.280
 And similar, there's a Chinese word, Aixi,

37:34.280 --> 37:37.480
 also written like Aixi, if you transcribe that to Pinyin.

37:37.480 --> 37:41.120
 And the final one is that it's AI crossed with induction

37:41.120 --> 37:44.680
 because that is, and that's going more to the content now.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.400
 So good old fashioned AI is more about planning

37:47.400 --> 37:48.760
 and known deterministic world

37:48.760 --> 37:51.800
 and induction is more about often IID data

37:51.800 --> 37:53.000
 and inferring models.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.880
 And essentially what this Aixi model does

37:54.880 --> 37:56.160
 is combining these two.

37:56.160 --> 37:59.480
 And I actually also recently, I think heard that

37:59.480 --> 38:02.280
 in Japanese AI means love.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.720
 So if you can combine XI somehow with that,

38:06.720 --> 38:10.320
 I think we can, there might be some interesting ideas there.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.640
 So Aixi, let's then take the next step.

38:12.640 --> 38:16.560
 Can you maybe talk at the big level

38:16.560 --> 38:19.480
 of what is this mathematical framework?

38:19.480 --> 38:22.560
 Yeah, so it consists essentially of two parts.

38:22.560 --> 38:26.520
 One is the learning and induction and prediction part.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.680
 And the other one is the planning part.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.200
 So let's come first to the learning,

38:31.200 --> 38:32.840
 induction, prediction part,

38:32.840 --> 38:35.640
 which essentially I explained already before.

38:35.640 --> 38:40.640
 So what we need for any agent to act well

38:40.680 --> 38:43.480
 is that it can somehow predict what happens.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.040
 I mean, if you have no idea what your actions do,

38:47.080 --> 38:48.920
 how can you decide which actions are good or not?

38:48.920 --> 38:52.840
 So you need to have some model of what your actions effect.

38:52.840 --> 38:56.160
 So what you do is you have some experience,

38:56.160 --> 38:59.360
 you build models like scientists of your experience,

38:59.360 --> 39:01.400
 then you hope these models are roughly correct,

39:01.400 --> 39:03.480
 and then you use these models for prediction.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.200
 And the model is, sorry to interrupt,

39:05.200 --> 39:08.360
 and the model is based on your perception of the world,

39:08.360 --> 39:10.480
 how your actions will affect that world.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.080
 That's not...

39:12.080 --> 39:12.920
 So how do you think about a model?

39:12.920 --> 39:14.280
 That's not the important part,

39:14.280 --> 39:16.000
 but it is technically important,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.240
 but at this stage we can just think about predicting,

39:18.240 --> 39:20.760
 let's say, stock market data, weather data,

39:20.760 --> 39:23.240
 or IQ sequences, one, two, three, four, five,

39:23.240 --> 39:24.520
 what comes next, yeah?

39:24.520 --> 39:28.680
 So of course our actions affect what we're doing,

39:28.680 --> 39:30.240
 but I'll come back to that in a second.

39:30.240 --> 39:32.160
 So, and I'll keep just interrupting.

39:32.160 --> 39:37.000
 So just to draw a line between prediction and planning,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.880
 what do you mean by prediction in this way?

39:40.880 --> 39:43.640
 It's trying to predict the environment

39:43.640 --> 39:47.280
 without your long term action in the environment?

39:47.280 --> 39:48.240
 What is prediction?

39:49.480 --> 39:51.160
 Okay, if you want to put the actions in now,

39:51.160 --> 39:53.680
 okay, then let's put it in now, yeah?

39:53.680 --> 39:54.720
 So...

39:54.720 --> 39:55.560
 We don't have to put them now.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.400
 Yeah, yeah.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.360
 Scratch it, scratch it, dumb question, okay.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.280
 So the simplest form of prediction is

40:01.280 --> 40:04.840
 that you just have data which you passively observe,

40:04.840 --> 40:06.160
 and you want to predict what happens

40:06.160 --> 40:08.960
 without interfering, as I said,

40:08.960 --> 40:12.120
 weather forecasting, stock market, IQ sequences,

40:12.120 --> 40:16.240
 or just anything, okay?

40:16.240 --> 40:18.920
 And Solomonov's theory of induction based on compression,

40:18.920 --> 40:20.400
 so you look for the shortest program

40:20.400 --> 40:22.240
 which describes your data sequence,

40:22.240 --> 40:24.440
 and then you take this program, run it,

40:24.440 --> 40:26.920
 it reproduces your data sequence by definition,

40:26.920 --> 40:29.000
 and then you let it continue running,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.880
 and then it will produce some predictions,

40:30.880 --> 40:35.880
 and you can rigorously prove that for any prediction task,

40:37.160 --> 40:40.040
 this is essentially the best possible predictor.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.040
 Of course, if there's a prediction task,

40:43.680 --> 40:45.080
 or a task which is unpredictable,

40:45.080 --> 40:46.720
 like, you know, you have fair coin flips.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.160
 Yeah, I cannot predict the next fair coin flip.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.160
 What Solomonov does is says,

40:49.160 --> 40:51.640
 okay, next head is probably 50%.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.600
 It's the best you can do.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.080
 So if something is unpredictable,

40:54.080 --> 40:56.600
 Solomonov will also not magically predict it.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.640
 But if there is some pattern and predictability,

40:59.640 --> 41:03.760
 then Solomonov induction will figure that out eventually,

41:03.760 --> 41:06.040
 and not just eventually, but rather quickly,

41:06.040 --> 41:08.400
 and you can have proof convergence rates,

41:10.640 --> 41:11.720
 whatever your data is.

41:11.720 --> 41:14.760
 So there's pure magic in a sense.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.600
 What's the catch?

41:15.600 --> 41:17.040
 Well, the catch is that it's not computable,

41:17.040 --> 41:18.200
 and we come back to that later.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.720
 You cannot just implement it

41:19.720 --> 41:21.160
 even with Google resources here,

41:21.160 --> 41:24.000
 and run it and predict the stock market and become rich.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.160
 I mean, Ray Solomonov already tried it at the time.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.680
 But so the basic task is you're in the environment,

41:31.680 --> 41:33.200
 and you're interacting with the environment

41:33.200 --> 41:35.400
 to try to learn to model that environment,

41:35.400 --> 41:38.760
 and the model is in the space of all these programs,

41:38.760 --> 41:41.360
 and your goal is to get a bunch of programs that are simple.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.040
 Yeah, so let's go to the actions now.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.080
 But actually, good that you asked.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.400
 Usually I skip this part,

41:46.400 --> 41:48.760
 although there is also a minor contribution which I did,

41:48.760 --> 41:49.720
 so the action part,

41:49.720 --> 41:51.800
 but I usually sort of just jump to the decision part.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.400
 So let me explain the action part now.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.320
 Thanks for asking.

41:55.440 --> 41:57.760
 So you have to modify it a little bit

41:58.760 --> 42:01.080
 by now not just predicting a sequence

42:01.080 --> 42:03.240
 which just comes to you,

42:03.240 --> 42:06.760
 but you have an observation, then you act somehow,

42:06.760 --> 42:09.120
 and then you want to predict the next observation

42:09.120 --> 42:11.920
 based on the past observation and your action.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.680
 Then you take the next action.

42:14.680 --> 42:17.240
 You don't care about predicting it because you're doing it.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.040
 Then you get the next observation,

42:19.040 --> 42:20.680
 and you want, well, before you get it,

42:20.680 --> 42:21.880
 you want to predict it, again,

42:21.880 --> 42:24.880
 based on your past action and observation sequence.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.720
 You just condition extra on your actions.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.520
 There's an interesting alternative

42:30.520 --> 42:33.400
 that you also try to predict your own actions.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.600
 If you want.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.960
 In the past or the future?

42:37.960 --> 42:39.720
 In your future actions.

42:39.720 --> 42:40.560
 That's interesting.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.480
 Yeah. Wait, let me wrap.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.800
 I think my brain just broke.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.440
 We should maybe discuss that later

42:47.440 --> 42:48.760
 after I've explained the IXE model.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.160
 That's an interesting variation.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.080
 But that is a really interesting variation,

42:52.080 --> 42:53.080
 and a quick comment.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.440
 I don't know if you want to insert that in here,

42:55.440 --> 42:59.200
 but you're looking at the, in terms of observations,

42:59.200 --> 43:01.640
 you're looking at the entire, the big history,

43:01.640 --> 43:03.320
 the long history of the observations.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.440
 Exactly. That's very important.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.520
 The whole history from birth sort of of the agent,

43:07.520 --> 43:09.080
 and we can come back to that.

43:09.080 --> 43:10.840
 And also why this is important.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.560
 Often, you know, in RL, you have MDPs,

43:13.560 --> 43:15.840
 micro decision processes, which are much more limiting.

43:15.840 --> 43:19.880
 Okay. So now we can predict conditioned on actions.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.600
 So even if you influence environment,

43:21.600 --> 43:24.120
 but prediction is not all we want to do, right?

43:24.120 --> 43:26.960
 We also want to act really in the world.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.120
 And the question is how to choose the actions.

43:29.120 --> 43:32.360
 And we don't want to greedily choose the actions,

43:33.320 --> 43:36.480
 you know, just, you know, what is best in the next time step.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.360
 And we first, I should say, you know, what is, you know,

43:38.360 --> 43:39.960
 how do we measure performance?

43:39.960 --> 43:43.360
 So we measure performance by giving the agent reward.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.640
 That's the so called reinforcement learning framework.

43:45.640 --> 43:48.560
 So every time step, you can give it a positive reward

43:48.560 --> 43:50.320
 or negative reward, or maybe no reward.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.880
 It could be a very scarce, right?

43:51.880 --> 43:54.160
 Like if you play chess, just at the end of the game,

43:54.160 --> 43:56.920
 you give plus one for winning or minus one for losing.

43:56.920 --> 43:59.240
 So in the RxC framework, that's completely sufficient.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.440
 So occasionally you give a reward signal

44:01.440 --> 44:04.040
 and you ask the agent to maximize reward,

44:04.040 --> 44:06.400
 but not greedily sort of, you know, the next one, next one,

44:06.400 --> 44:10.040
 because that's very bad in the long run if you're greedy.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.440
 So, but over the lifetime of the agent.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.600
 So let's assume the agent lives for M time steps,

44:14.600 --> 44:16.920
 or say dies in sort of a hundred years sharp.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.720
 That's just, you know, the simplest model to explain.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.120
 So it looks at the future reward sum

44:22.120 --> 44:24.840
 and ask what is my action sequence,

44:24.840 --> 44:26.920
 or actually more precisely my policy,

44:26.920 --> 44:31.160
 which leads in expectation, because I don't know the world,

44:32.160 --> 44:34.120
 to the maximum reward sum.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.120
 Let me give you an analogy.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.240
 In chess, for instance,

44:38.240 --> 44:40.320
 we know how to play optimally in theory.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.160
 It's just a mini max strategy.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.400
 I play the move which seems best to me

44:44.400 --> 44:46.840
 under the assumption that the opponent plays the move

44:46.840 --> 44:48.600
 which is best for him.

44:48.600 --> 44:52.240
 So best, so worst for me under the assumption that he,

44:52.240 --> 44:54.040
 I play again, the best move.

44:54.040 --> 44:55.960
 And then you have this expecting max three

44:55.960 --> 44:58.880
 to the end of the game, and then you back propagate,

44:58.880 --> 45:00.760
 and then you get the best possible move.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.160
 So that is the optimal strategy,

45:02.160 --> 45:06.200
 which von Neumann already figured out a long time ago,

45:06.200 --> 45:09.000
 for playing adversarial games.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.640
 Luckily, or maybe unluckily for the theory,

45:11.640 --> 45:12.480
 it becomes harder.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.960
 The world is not always adversarial.

45:14.960 --> 45:17.240
 So it can be, if there are other humans,

45:17.240 --> 45:20.120
 even cooperative, or nature is usually,

45:20.120 --> 45:22.720
 I mean, the dead nature is stochastic, you know,

45:22.720 --> 45:26.840
 things just happen randomly, or don't care about you.

45:26.840 --> 45:29.440
 So what you have to take into account is the noise,

45:29.440 --> 45:30.760
 and not necessarily adversarialty.

45:30.760 --> 45:34.040
 So you replace the minimum on the opponent's side

45:34.040 --> 45:36.040
 by an expectation,

45:36.040 --> 45:40.080
 which is general enough to include also adversarial cases.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.600
 So now instead of a mini max strategy,

45:41.600 --> 45:43.840
 you have an expected max strategy.

45:43.840 --> 45:44.680
 So far, so good.

45:44.680 --> 45:45.520
 So that is well known.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.040
 It's called sequential decision theory.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.480
 But the question is,

45:49.480 --> 45:52.480
 on which probability distribution do you base that?

45:52.480 --> 45:55.400
 If I have the true probability distribution,

45:55.400 --> 45:56.960
 like say I play backgammon, right?

45:56.960 --> 45:59.360
 There's dice, and there's certain randomness involved.

45:59.360 --> 46:00.960
 Yeah, I can calculate probabilities

46:00.960 --> 46:02.640
 and feed it in the expected max,

46:02.640 --> 46:04.160
 or the sequential decision tree,

46:04.160 --> 46:07.160
 come up with the optimal decision if I have enough compute.

46:07.160 --> 46:09.760
 But for the real world, we don't know that, you know,

46:09.760 --> 46:13.960
 what is the probability the driver in front of me breaks?

46:13.960 --> 46:14.920
 I don't know.

46:14.920 --> 46:16.920
 So depends on all kinds of things,

46:16.920 --> 46:19.640
 and especially new situations, I don't know.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.520
 So this is this unknown thing about prediction,

46:22.520 --> 46:24.240
 and there's where Solomonov comes in.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.360
 So what you do is in sequential decision tree,

46:26.360 --> 46:28.680
 you just replace the true distribution,

46:28.680 --> 46:32.960
 which we don't know, by this universal distribution.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.640
 I didn't explicitly talk about it,

46:34.640 --> 46:36.800
 but this is used for universal prediction

46:36.800 --> 46:40.280
 and plug it into the sequential decision tree mechanism.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.680
 And then you get the best of both worlds.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.680
 You have a long term planning agent,

46:45.560 --> 46:48.080
 but it doesn't need to know anything about the world

46:48.080 --> 46:51.640
 because the Solomonov induction part learns.

46:51.640 --> 46:54.720
 Can you explicitly try to describe

46:54.720 --> 46:56.080
 the universal distribution

46:56.080 --> 46:59.680
 and how Solomonov induction plays a role here?

46:59.680 --> 47:00.760
 I'm trying to understand.

47:00.760 --> 47:03.840
 So what it does it, so in the simplest case,

47:03.840 --> 47:06.600
 I said, take the shortest program, describing your data,

47:06.600 --> 47:09.040
 run it, have a prediction which would be deterministic.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.760
 Yes. Okay.

47:10.760 --> 47:13.160
 But you should not just take the shortest program,

47:13.160 --> 47:15.320
 but also consider the longer ones,

47:15.320 --> 47:18.480
 but give it lower a priori probability.

47:18.480 --> 47:22.400
 So in the Bayesian framework, you say a priori,

47:22.400 --> 47:27.400
 any distribution, which is a model or a stochastic program,

47:29.360 --> 47:30.760
 has a certain a priori probability,

47:30.760 --> 47:33.320
 which is two to the minus, and why two to the minus length?

47:33.320 --> 47:35.520
 You know, I could explain length of this program.

47:35.520 --> 47:39.760
 So longer programs are punished a priori.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.360
 And then you multiply it

47:41.360 --> 47:43.840
 with the so called likelihood function,

47:43.840 --> 47:46.720
 which is, as the name suggests,

47:46.720 --> 47:51.000
 is how likely is this model given the data at hand.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.240
 So if you have a very wrong model,

47:53.240 --> 47:55.000
 it's very unlikely that this model is true.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.760
 And so it is very small number.

47:56.760 --> 48:00.320
 So even if the model is simple, it gets penalized by that.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.480
 And what you do is then you take just the sum,

48:02.480 --> 48:04.440
 or this is the average over it.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.600
 And this gives you a probability distribution.

48:07.600 --> 48:10.480
 So it's universal distribution or Solomonov distribution.

48:10.480 --> 48:13.160
 So it's weighed by the simplicity of the program

48:13.160 --> 48:14.120
 and the likelihood.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.320
 Yes.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.280
 It's kind of a nice idea.

48:17.280 --> 48:18.120
 Yeah.

48:18.120 --> 48:23.120
 So okay, and then you said there's you're playing N or M

48:23.280 --> 48:25.960
 or forgot the letter steps into the future.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.320
 So how difficult is that problem?

48:28.320 --> 48:29.520
 What's involved there?

48:29.520 --> 48:31.320
 Okay, so basic optimization problem.

48:31.320 --> 48:32.160
 What are we talking about?

48:32.160 --> 48:34.920
 Yeah, so you have a planning problem up to horizon M,

48:34.920 --> 48:38.040
 and that's exponential time in the horizon M,

48:38.040 --> 48:41.760
 which is, I mean, it's computable, but intractable.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.520
 I mean, even for chess, it's already intractable

48:43.520 --> 48:44.360
 to do that exactly.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.440
 And you know, for goal.

48:45.440 --> 48:48.680
 But it could be also discounted kind of framework where.

48:48.680 --> 48:52.960
 Yeah, so having a hard horizon, you know, at 100 years,

48:52.960 --> 48:55.800
 it's just for simplicity of discussing the model

48:55.800 --> 48:57.720
 and also sometimes the math is simple.

48:58.960 --> 49:00.000
 But there are lots of variations,

49:00.000 --> 49:03.360
 actually quite interesting parameter.

49:03.360 --> 49:07.240
 There's nothing really problematic about it,

49:07.240 --> 49:08.240
 but it's very interesting.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.280
 So for instance, you think, no,

49:09.280 --> 49:12.880
 let's let the parameter M tend to infinity, right?

49:12.880 --> 49:15.840
 You want an agent which lives forever, right?

49:15.840 --> 49:17.480
 If you do it normally, you have two problems.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.160
 First, the mathematics breaks down

49:19.160 --> 49:21.360
 because you have an infinite reward sum,

49:21.360 --> 49:22.720
 which may give infinity,

49:22.720 --> 49:25.560
 and getting reward 0.1 every time step is infinity,

49:25.560 --> 49:27.600
 and giving reward one every time step is infinity,

49:27.600 --> 49:28.600
 so equally good.

49:29.480 --> 49:31.080
 Not really what we want.

49:31.080 --> 49:35.760
 Other problem is that if you have an infinite life,

49:35.760 --> 49:38.560
 you can be lazy for as long as you want for 10 years

49:38.560 --> 49:41.400
 and then catch up with the same expected reward.

49:41.400 --> 49:46.400
 And think about yourself or maybe some friends or so.

49:47.240 --> 49:51.440
 If they knew they lived forever, why work hard now?

49:51.440 --> 49:54.240
 Just enjoy your life and then catch up later.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.600
 So that's another problem with infinite horizon.

49:56.600 --> 49:59.760
 And you mentioned, yes, we can go to discounting,

49:59.760 --> 50:01.200
 but then the standard discounting

50:01.200 --> 50:03.080
 is so called geometric discounting.

50:03.080 --> 50:05.400
 So a dollar today is about worth

50:05.400 --> 50:08.320
 as much as $1.05 tomorrow.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.320
 So if you do the so called geometric discounting,

50:10.320 --> 50:12.960
 you have introduced an effective horizon.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.960
 So the agent is now motivated to look ahead

50:15.960 --> 50:18.360
 a certain amount of time effectively.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.600
 It's like a moving horizon.

50:20.600 --> 50:23.840
 And for any fixed effective horizon,

50:23.840 --> 50:26.520
 there is a problem to solve,

50:26.520 --> 50:28.080
 which requires larger horizon.

50:28.080 --> 50:30.440
 So if I look ahead five time steps,

50:30.440 --> 50:32.440
 I'm a terrible chess player, right?

50:32.440 --> 50:34.560
 I'll need to look ahead longer.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.720
 If I play go, I probably have to look ahead even longer.

50:36.720 --> 50:40.280
 So for every problem, for every horizon,

50:40.280 --> 50:43.800
 there is a problem which this horizon cannot solve.

50:43.800 --> 50:46.960
 But I introduced the so called near harmonic horizon,

50:46.960 --> 50:48.360
 which goes down with one over T

50:48.360 --> 50:49.960
 rather than exponential in T,

50:49.960 --> 50:51.600
 which produces an agent,

50:51.600 --> 50:53.880
 which effectively looks into the future

50:53.880 --> 50:55.200
 proportional to each age.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.360
 So if it's five years old, it plans for five years.

50:57.360 --> 51:00.440
 If it's 100 years old, it then plans for 100 years.

51:00.440 --> 51:02.480
 And it's a little bit similar to humans too, right?

51:02.480 --> 51:04.320
 I mean, children don't plan ahead very long,

51:04.320 --> 51:07.080
 but then we get adult, we play ahead more longer.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.560
 Maybe when we get very old,

51:08.560 --> 51:10.360
 I mean, we know that we don't live forever.

51:10.360 --> 51:12.840
 Maybe then our horizon shrinks again.

51:12.840 --> 51:16.040
 So that's really interesting.

51:16.040 --> 51:18.120
 So adjusting the horizon,

51:18.120 --> 51:20.680
 is there some mathematical benefit of that?

51:20.680 --> 51:21.880
 Or is it just a nice,

51:22.960 --> 51:25.560
 I mean, intuitively, empirically,

51:25.560 --> 51:26.560
 it would probably be a good idea

51:26.560 --> 51:27.960
 to sort of push the horizon back,

51:27.960 --> 51:32.960
 extend the horizon as you experience more of the world.

51:33.480 --> 51:35.840
 But is there some mathematical conclusions here

51:35.840 --> 51:37.240
 that are beneficial?

51:37.240 --> 51:38.920
 With solomonic reductions or the prediction part,

51:38.920 --> 51:41.400
 we have extremely strong finite time,

51:42.320 --> 51:44.760
 but not finite data results.

51:44.760 --> 51:46.000
 So you have so and so much data,

51:46.000 --> 51:47.160
 then you lose so and so much.

51:47.160 --> 51:49.400
 So it's a, the theory is really great.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.920
 With the ICSE model, with the planning part,

51:51.920 --> 51:56.800
 many results are only asymptotic, which, well, this is...

51:56.800 --> 51:57.640
 What does asymptotic mean?

51:57.640 --> 51:59.920
 Asymptotic means you can prove, for instance,

51:59.920 --> 52:02.360
 that in the long run, if the agent, you know,

52:02.360 --> 52:04.160
 acts long enough, then, you know,

52:04.160 --> 52:06.400
 it performs optimal or some nice thing happens.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.480
 So, but you don't know how fast it converges.

52:09.480 --> 52:10.880
 So it may converge fast,

52:10.880 --> 52:12.280
 but we're just not able to prove it

52:12.280 --> 52:13.760
 because of a difficult problem.

52:13.760 --> 52:17.320
 Or maybe there's a bug in the model

52:17.320 --> 52:19.520
 so that it's really that slow.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.800
 So that is what asymptotic means,

52:21.800 --> 52:24.680
 sort of eventually, but we don't know how fast.

52:24.680 --> 52:27.920
 And if I give the agent a fixed horizon M,

52:28.920 --> 52:32.240
 then I cannot prove asymptotic results, right?

52:32.240 --> 52:35.040
 So I mean, sort of if it dies in a hundred years,

52:35.040 --> 52:37.840
 then in a hundred years it's over, I cannot say eventually.

52:37.840 --> 52:40.600
 So this is the advantage of the discounting

52:40.600 --> 52:42.760
 that I can prove asymptotic results.

52:42.760 --> 52:46.960
 So just to clarify, so I, okay, I made,

52:46.960 --> 52:51.720
 I've built up a model, we're now in the moment of,

52:51.720 --> 52:55.360
 I have this way of looking several steps ahead.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.840
 How do I pick what action I will take?

52:58.880 --> 53:00.720
 It's like with the playing chess, right?

53:00.720 --> 53:02.320
 You do this minimax.

53:02.320 --> 53:05.240
 In this case here, do expectimax based on the solomonov

53:05.240 --> 53:08.000
 distribution, you propagate back,

53:09.000 --> 53:12.080
 and then while an action falls out,

53:12.080 --> 53:15.480
 the action which maximizes the future expected reward

53:15.480 --> 53:16.800
 on the solomonov distribution,

53:16.800 --> 53:18.240
 and then you just take this action.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.640
 And then repeat.

53:19.640 --> 53:20.960
 And then you get a new observation,

53:20.960 --> 53:22.640
 and you feed it in this action observation,

53:22.640 --> 53:23.480
 then you repeat.

53:23.480 --> 53:24.880
 And the reward, so on.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.760
 Yeah, so you rewrote too, yeah.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.080
 And then maybe you can even predict your own action.

53:29.080 --> 53:29.960
 I love that idea.

53:29.960 --> 53:33.160
 But okay, this big framework,

53:33.160 --> 53:35.600
 what is it, I mean,

53:36.560 --> 53:38.840
 it's kind of a beautiful mathematical framework

53:38.840 --> 53:41.880
 to think about artificial general intelligence.

53:41.880 --> 53:45.800
 What can you, what does it help you into it

53:45.800 --> 53:49.080
 about how to build such systems?

53:49.080 --> 53:51.720
 Or maybe from another perspective,

53:51.720 --> 53:56.720
 what does it help us in understanding AGI?

53:56.720 --> 54:00.440
 So when I started in the field,

54:00.440 --> 54:01.800
 I was always interested in two things.

54:01.800 --> 54:05.800
 One was AGI, the name didn't exist then,

54:05.800 --> 54:09.200
 what's called general AI or strong AI,

54:09.200 --> 54:10.800
 and the physics theory of everything.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.120
 So I switched back and forth between computer science

54:13.120 --> 54:14.680
 and physics quite often.

54:14.680 --> 54:15.960
 You said the theory of everything.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.360
 The theory of everything, yeah.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.240
 Those are basically the two biggest problems

54:19.240 --> 54:21.360
 before all of humanity.

54:21.360 --> 54:26.360
 Yeah, I can explain if you wanted some later time,

54:28.480 --> 54:29.960
 why I'm interested in these two questions.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.080
 Can I ask you in a small tangent,

54:32.080 --> 54:37.080
 if it was one to be solved,

54:37.120 --> 54:38.600
 which one would you,

54:38.600 --> 54:41.800
 if an apple fell on your head

54:41.800 --> 54:43.280
 and there was a brilliant insight

54:43.280 --> 54:46.360
 and you could arrive at the solution to one,

54:46.360 --> 54:49.200
 would it be AGI or the theory of everything?

54:49.200 --> 54:51.800
 Definitely AGI, because once the AGI problem is solved,

54:51.800 --> 54:54.400
 I can ask the AGI to solve the other problem for me.

54:56.520 --> 54:57.720
 Yeah, brilliant input.

54:57.720 --> 55:01.200
 Okay, so as you were saying about it.

55:01.200 --> 55:04.960
 Okay, so, and the reason why I didn't settle,

55:04.960 --> 55:07.400
 I mean, this thought about,

55:07.400 --> 55:09.960
 once you have solved AGI, it solves all kinds of other,

55:09.960 --> 55:11.240
 not just the theory of every problem,

55:11.240 --> 55:14.160
 but all kinds of more useful problems to humanity

55:14.160 --> 55:16.280
 is very appealing to many people.

55:16.280 --> 55:18.240
 And I had this thought also,

55:18.240 --> 55:23.240
 but I was quite disappointed with the state of the art

55:23.960 --> 55:25.440
 of the field of AI.

55:25.440 --> 55:28.160
 There was some theory about logical reasoning,

55:28.160 --> 55:30.600
 but I was never convinced that this will fly.

55:30.600 --> 55:33.320
 And then there was this more heuristic approaches

55:33.320 --> 55:37.480
 with neural networks and I didn't like these heuristics.

55:37.480 --> 55:40.320
 So, and also I didn't have any good idea myself.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.240
 So that's the reason why I toggled back and forth

55:44.240 --> 55:46.360
 quite some while and even worked four and a half years

55:46.360 --> 55:48.240
 in a company developing software,

55:48.240 --> 55:49.680
 something completely unrelated.

55:49.680 --> 55:52.800
 But then I had this idea about the ICSE model.

55:52.800 --> 55:57.760
 And so what it gives you, it gives you a gold standard.

55:57.760 --> 56:02.360
 So I have proven that this is the most intelligent agents

56:02.360 --> 56:06.840
 which anybody could build in quotation mark,

56:06.840 --> 56:08.200
 because it's just mathematical

56:08.200 --> 56:11.160
 and you need infinite compute.

56:11.160 --> 56:14.920
 But this is the limit and this is completely specified.

56:14.920 --> 56:19.280
 It's not just a framework and every year,

56:19.280 --> 56:21.200
 tens of frameworks are developed,

56:21.200 --> 56:23.920
 which are just skeletons and then pieces are missing.

56:23.920 --> 56:25.360
 And usually these missing pieces,

56:25.360 --> 56:27.360
 turn out to be really, really difficult.

56:27.360 --> 56:31.080
 And so this is completely and uniquely defined

56:31.080 --> 56:33.480
 and we can analyze that mathematically.

56:33.480 --> 56:37.320
 And we've also developed some approximations.

56:37.320 --> 56:40.280
 I can talk about that a little bit later.

56:40.280 --> 56:41.800
 That would be sort of the top down approach,

56:41.800 --> 56:44.240
 like say for Neumann's minimax theory,

56:44.240 --> 56:47.240
 that's the theoretical optimal play of games.

56:47.240 --> 56:48.800
 And now we need to approximate it,

56:48.800 --> 56:51.040
 put heuristics in, prune the tree, blah, blah, blah,

56:51.040 --> 56:51.880
 and so on.

56:51.880 --> 56:53.200
 So we can do that also with the ICSE model,

56:53.200 --> 56:54.280
 but for general AI.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.640
 It can also inspire those,

56:57.640 --> 57:00.840
 and most researchers go bottom up, right?

57:00.840 --> 57:01.680
 They have the systems,

57:01.680 --> 57:04.160
 they try to make it more general, more intelligent.

57:04.160 --> 57:07.040
 It can inspire in which direction to go.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.120
 What do you mean by that?

57:09.120 --> 57:11.200
 So if you have some choice to make, right?

57:11.200 --> 57:13.120
 So how should I evaluate my system

57:13.120 --> 57:15.400
 if I can't do cross validation?

57:15.400 --> 57:18.040
 How should I do my learning

57:18.040 --> 57:21.480
 if my standard regularization doesn't work well?

57:21.480 --> 57:22.520
 So the answer is always this,

57:22.520 --> 57:25.000
 we have a system which does everything, that's ICSE.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.760
 It's just completely in the ivory tower,

57:27.760 --> 57:30.600
 completely useless from a practical point of view.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.920
 But you can look at it and see,

57:31.920 --> 57:34.920
 ah, yeah, maybe I can take some aspects.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.520
 And instead of Kolmogorov complexity,

57:36.520 --> 57:38.160
 that just takes some compressors,

57:38.160 --> 57:39.960
 which has been developed so far.

57:39.960 --> 57:42.120
 And for the planning, well, we have UCT,

57:42.120 --> 57:44.360
 which has also been used in Go.

57:45.240 --> 57:50.040
 And at least it's inspired me a lot

57:50.040 --> 57:54.160
 to have this formal definition.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.800
 And if you look at other fields,

57:55.800 --> 57:57.720
 like I always come back to physics

57:57.720 --> 57:58.960
 because I have a physics background,

57:58.960 --> 58:00.680
 think about the phenomenon of energy.

58:00.680 --> 58:03.160
 That was long time a mysterious concept.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.880
 And at some point it was completely formalized.

58:05.880 --> 58:08.160
 And that really helped a lot.

58:08.160 --> 58:10.720
 And you can point out a lot of these things

58:10.720 --> 58:12.960
 which were first mysterious and vague,

58:12.960 --> 58:15.160
 and then they have been rigorously formalized.

58:15.160 --> 58:18.240
 Speed and acceleration has been confused, right?

58:18.240 --> 58:19.680
 Until it was formally defined,

58:19.680 --> 58:21.040
 yeah, there was a time like this.

58:21.040 --> 58:25.080
 And people often who don't have any background,

58:25.080 --> 58:26.200
 still confuse it.

58:28.280 --> 58:31.920
 And this ICSE model or the intelligence definitions,

58:31.920 --> 58:33.160
 which is sort of the dual to it,

58:33.160 --> 58:34.640
 we come back to that later,

58:34.640 --> 58:37.160
 formalizes the notion of intelligence

58:37.160 --> 58:38.880
 uniquely and rigorously.

58:38.880 --> 58:41.640
 So in a sense, it serves as kind of the light

58:41.640 --> 58:43.000
 at the end of the tunnel.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.800
 So for, I mean, there's a million questions

58:46.800 --> 58:47.720
 I could ask her.

58:47.720 --> 58:50.280
 So maybe kind of, okay,

58:50.280 --> 58:52.080
 let's feel around in the dark a little bit.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.720
 So there's been here a deep mind,

58:54.720 --> 58:56.960
 but in general, been a lot of breakthrough ideas,

58:56.960 --> 58:59.480
 just like we've been saying around reinforcement learning.

58:59.480 --> 59:02.080
 So how do you see the progress

59:02.080 --> 59:04.440
 in reinforcement learning is different?

59:04.440 --> 59:08.080
 Like which subset of ICSE does it occupy?

59:08.080 --> 59:10.600
 The current, like you said,

59:10.600 --> 59:14.520
 maybe the Markov assumption is made quite often

59:14.520 --> 59:16.280
 in reinforcement learning.

59:16.280 --> 59:20.240
 There's other assumptions made

59:20.240 --> 59:21.560
 in order to make the system work.

59:21.560 --> 59:24.200
 What do you see as the difference connection

59:24.200 --> 59:26.800
 between reinforcement learning and ICSE?

59:26.800 --> 59:29.000
 And so the major difference is that

59:30.560 --> 59:33.280
 essentially all other approaches,

59:33.280 --> 59:35.600
 they make stronger assumptions.

59:35.600 --> 59:38.320
 So in reinforcement learning, the Markov assumption

59:38.320 --> 59:41.520
 is that the next state or next observation

59:41.520 --> 59:43.360
 only depends on the previous observation

59:43.360 --> 59:45.240
 and not the whole history,

59:45.240 --> 59:47.560
 which makes, of course, the mathematics much easier

59:47.560 --> 59:49.800
 rather than dealing with histories.

59:49.800 --> 59:51.600
 Of course, they profit from it also,

59:51.600 --> 59:53.080
 because then you have algorithms

59:53.080 --> 59:54.320
 that run on current computers

59:54.320 --> 59:56.640
 and do something practically useful.

59:56.640 --> 59:59.680
 But for general AI, all the assumptions

59:59.680 --> 1:00:01.720
 which are made by other approaches,

1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:04.040
 we know already now they are limiting.

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:07.760
 So, for instance, usually you need

1:00:07.760 --> 1:00:09.840
 a goddessity assumption in the MDP frameworks

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:10.680
 in order to learn.

1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:13.800
 A goddessity essentially means that you can recover

1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:15.800
 from your mistakes and that there are no traps

1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:17.400
 in the environment.

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:19.040
 And if you make this assumption,

1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:22.040
 then essentially you can go back to a previous state,

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:24.320
 go there a couple of times and then learn

1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:29.040
 what statistics and what the state is like,

1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:32.520
 and then in the long run perform well in this state.

1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:35.200
 But there are no fundamental problems.

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:38.480
 But in real life, we know there can be one single action.

1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:43.480
 One second of being inattentive while driving a car fast

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:45.240
 can ruin the rest of my life.

1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:47.800
 I can become quadriplegic or whatever.

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:49.680
 So, and there's no recovery anymore.

1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:52.160
 So, the real world is not ergodic, I always say.

1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:53.920
 There are traps and there are situations

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:55.760
 where you are not recover from.

1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:00.760
 And very little theory has been developed for this case.

1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:05.760
 What about, what do you see in the context of IECSIA

1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:07.960
 as the role of exploration?

1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:12.960
 Sort of, you mentioned in the real world

1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:16.120
 you can get into trouble when we make the wrong decisions

1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:17.480
 and really pay for it.

1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:20.480
 But exploration seems to be fundamentally important

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:23.760
 for learning about this world, for gaining new knowledge.

1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:27.360
 So, is exploration baked in?

1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:29.680
 Another way to ask it, what are the potential

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:34.360
 to ask it, what are the parameters of IECSIA

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:36.200
 that can be controlled?

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.880
 Yeah, I say the good thing is that there are no parameters

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.200
 to control.

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:43.120
 Some other people track knobs to control.

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:44.120
 And you can do that.

1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:46.880
 I mean, you can modify IECSIA so that you have some knobs

1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:48.800
 to play with if you want to.

1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:53.640
 But the exploration is directly baked in.

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:56.960
 And that comes from the Bayesian learning

1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.680
 and the longterm planning.

1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:03.680
 So these together already imply exploration.

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:08.280
 You can nicely and explicitly prove that

1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:13.280
 for simple problems like so called bandit problems,

1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:18.000
 where you say, to give a real world example,

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.200
 say you have two medical treatments, A and B,

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:21.560
 you don't know the effectiveness,

1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:23.360
 you try A a little bit, B a little bit,

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:25.760
 but you don't want to harm too many patients.

1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:29.800
 So you have to sort of trade off exploring.

1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:31.720
 And at some point you want to explore

1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:34.080
 and you can do the mathematics

1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:36.080
 and figure out the optimal strategy.

1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:39.120
 They talk about Bayesian agents,

1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:41.120
 they're also non Bayesian agents,

1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:44.240
 but it shows that this Bayesian framework

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:47.400
 by taking a prior or possible worlds,

1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:48.440
 doing the Bayesian mixture,

1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:50.640
 then the Bayes optimal decision with longterm planning

1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.320
 that is important,

1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:55.880
 automatically implies exploration,

1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:57.600
 also to the proper extent,

1:02:57.600 --> 1:02:59.680
 not too much exploration and not too little.

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:01.520
 It is very simple settings.

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:04.400
 In the IXE model, I was also able to prove

1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:06.160
 that it is a self optimizing theorem

1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:07.720
 or asymptotic optimality theorems,

1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:10.480
 although they're only asymptotic, not finite time bounds.

1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:13.120
 So it seems like the longterm planning is really important,

1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:15.720
 but the longterm part of the planning is really important.

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.920
 And also, I mean, maybe a quick tangent,

1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:21.360
 how important do you think is removing

1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:25.320
 the Markov assumption and looking at the full history?

1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:28.040
 Sort of intuitively, of course, it's important,

1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:30.960
 but is it like fundamentally transformative

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:33.400
 to the entirety of the problem?

1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:34.320
 What's your sense of it?

1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:37.800
 Like, cause we all, we make that assumption quite often.

1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:40.000
 It's just throwing away the past.

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.800
 No, I think it's absolutely crucial.

1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:47.240
 The question is whether there's a way to deal with it

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:52.240
 in a more heuristic and still sufficiently well way.

1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:55.480
 So I have to come up with an example and fly,

1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:59.360
 but you have some key event in your life,

1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:02.080
 long time ago in some city or something,

1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:05.360
 you realized that's a really dangerous street or whatever.

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:08.000
 And you want to remember that forever,

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.760
 in case you come back there.

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:11.520
 Kind of a selective kind of memory.

1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:15.160
 So you remember all the important events in the past,

1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:17.480
 but somehow selecting the important is.

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:18.600
 That's very hard.

1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:21.720
 And I'm not concerned about just storing the whole history.

1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:26.640
 Just, you can calculate, human life says 30 or 100 years,

1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:28.600
 doesn't matter, right?

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:31.800
 How much data comes in through the vision system

1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:35.200
 and the auditory system, you compress it a little bit,

1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:37.560
 in this case, lossily and store it.

1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:40.520
 We are soon in the means of just storing it.

1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:44.920
 But you still need to the selection for the planning part

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:47.280
 and the compression for the understanding part.

1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:50.000
 The raw storage I'm really not concerned about.

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.240
 And I think we should just store,

1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:53.640
 if you develop an agent,

1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:59.400
 preferably just store all the interaction history.

1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:02.240
 And then you build of course models on top of it

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:04.960
 and you compress it and you are selective,

1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:08.120
 but occasionally you go back to the old data

1:05:08.120 --> 1:05:12.000
 and reanalyze it based on your new experience you have.

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:13.840
 Sometimes you are in school,

1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:16.800
 you learn all these things you think is totally useless

1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:18.200
 and much later you realize,

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:21.600
 oh, they were not so useless as you thought.

1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:24.080
 I'm looking at you, linear algebra.

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:25.160
 Right.

1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:27.720
 So maybe let me ask about objective functions

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:32.720
 because that rewards, it seems to be an important part.

1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:36.640
 The rewards are kind of given to the system.

1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:39.560
 For a lot of people,

1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:44.560
 the specification of the objective function

1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:48.440
 is a key part of intelligence.

1:05:48.440 --> 1:05:52.920
 The agent itself figuring out what is important.

1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:54.640
 What do you think about that?

1:05:54.640 --> 1:05:58.560
 Is it possible within the IXE framework

1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:01.880
 to yourself discover the reward

1:06:01.880 --> 1:06:03.700
 based on which you should operate?

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:07.080
 Okay, that will be a long answer.

1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:10.800
 So, and that is a very interesting question.

1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:13.360
 And I'm asked a lot about this question,

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.600
 where do the rewards come from?

1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:17.760
 And that depends.

1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:21.320
 So, and then I give you now a couple of answers.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:26.320
 So if you want to build agents, now let's start simple.

1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:28.680
 So let's assume we want to build an agent

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:33.200
 based on the IXE model, which performs a particular task.

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:34.720
 Let's start with something super simple,

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:37.320
 like, I mean, super simple, like playing chess,

1:06:37.320 --> 1:06:38.840
 or go or something, yeah.

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:42.480
 Then you just, the reward is winning the game is plus one,

1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:45.280
 losing the game is minus one, done.

1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:46.360
 You apply this agent.

1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:49.080
 If you have enough compute, you let it self play

1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:50.840
 and it will learn the rules of the game,

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:54.320
 will play perfect chess after some while, problem solved.

1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:58.520
 Okay, so if you have more complicated problems,

1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:03.640
 then you may believe that you have the right reward,

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:04.840
 but it's not.

1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:08.400
 So a nice, cute example is the elevator control

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:10.400
 that is also in Rich Sutton's book,

1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:12.200
 which is a great book, by the way.

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.640
 So you control the elevator and you think,

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:17.760
 well, maybe the reward should be coupled

1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:20.200
 to how long people wait in front of the elevator.

1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:21.840
 Long wait is bad.

1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:23.680
 You program it and you do it.

1:07:23.680 --> 1:07:25.840
 And what happens is the elevator eagerly picks up

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:28.040
 all the people, but never drops them off.

1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:33.120
 So then you realize, oh, maybe the time in the elevator

1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:36.280
 also counts, so you minimize the sum, yeah?

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:39.000
 And the elevator does that, but never picks up the people

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.400
 in the 10th floor and the top floor

1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:42.320
 because in expectation, it's not worth it.

1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:43.240
 Just let them stay.

1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:44.080
 Yeah.

1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:44.920
 Yeah.

1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:45.760
 Yeah.

1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:49.600
 So even in apparently simple problems,

1:07:49.600 --> 1:07:51.240
 you can make mistakes, yeah?

1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:55.240
 And that's what in more serious contexts

1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:58.000
 AGI safety researchers consider.

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.640
 So now let's go back to general agents.

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:02.360
 So assume you want to build an agent,

1:08:02.360 --> 1:08:05.080
 which is generally useful to humans, yeah?

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:07.440
 So you have a household robot, yeah?

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:09.840
 And it should do all kinds of tasks.

1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:13.440
 So in this case, the human should give the reward

1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:14.440
 on the fly.

1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:16.200
 I mean, maybe it's pre trained in the factory

1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:18.040
 and that there's some sort of internal reward

1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:19.920
 for the battery level or whatever, yeah?

1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:24.160
 But so it does the dishes badly, you punish the robot,

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:25.680
 it does it good, you reward the robot

1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:28.440
 and then train it to a new task, yeah, like a child, right?

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:31.160
 So you need the human in the loop.

1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:34.520
 If you want a system, which is useful to the human.

1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:37.960
 And as long as these agents stay subhuman level,

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:41.080
 that should work reasonably well,

1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:43.040
 apart from these examples.

1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:45.840
 It becomes critical if they become on a human level.

1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:47.200
 It's like with children, small children,

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:48.800
 you have reasonably well under control,

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:51.400
 they become older, the reward technique

1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:52.800
 doesn't work so well anymore.

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.600
 So then finally, so this would be agents,

1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:01.800
 which are just, you could say slaves to the humans, yeah?

1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:03.960
 So if you are more ambitious and just say,

1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:08.080
 we want to build a new species of intelligent beings,

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:09.360
 we put them on a new planet

1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:12.080
 and we want them to develop this planet or whatever.

1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:15.360
 So we don't give them any reward.

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:16.920
 So what could we do?

1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:21.080
 And you could try to come up with some reward functions

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:23.400
 like it should maintain itself, the robot,

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:28.000
 it should maybe multiply, build more robots, right?

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:33.000
 And maybe all kinds of things which you find useful,

1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.800
 but that's pretty hard, right?

1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:36.640
 What does self maintenance mean?

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.120
 What does it mean to build a copy?

1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:40.680
 Should it be exact copy, an approximate copy?

1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:42.040
 And so that's really hard,

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:47.040
 but Laurent also at DeepMind developed a beautiful model.

1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:50.560
 So it just took the ICSE model

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:54.960
 and coupled the rewards to information gain.

1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:57.840
 So he said the reward is proportional

1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:00.720
 to how much the agent had learned about the world.

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:03.320
 And you can rigorously, formally, uniquely define that

1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:05.840
 in terms of archival versions, okay?

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:09.880
 So if you put that in, you get a completely autonomous agent.

1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:11.680
 And actually, interestingly, for this agent,

1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:13.120
 we can prove much stronger result

1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:16.000
 than for the general agent, which is also nice.

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.080
 And if you let this agent loose,

1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:20.000
 it will be in a sense, the optimal scientist.

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.920
 It is absolutely curious to learn as much as possible

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:24.120
 about the world.

1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:25.720
 And of course, it will also have

1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:27.160
 a lot of instrumental goals, right?

1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:29.560
 In order to learn, it needs to at least survive, right?

1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:31.520
 A dead agent is not good for anything.

1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:33.960
 So it needs to have self preservation.

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:38.000
 And if it builds small helpers, acquiring more information,

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.120
 it will do that, yeah?

1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:43.680
 If exploration, space exploration or whatever is necessary,

1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:45.920
 right, to gathering information and develop it.

1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:48.200
 So it has a lot of instrumental goals

1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:51.000
 falling on this information gain.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.760
 And this agent is completely autonomous of us.

1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:55.640
 No rewards necessary anymore.

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:57.560
 Yeah, of course, it could find a way

1:10:57.560 --> 1:10:59.600
 to game the concept of information

1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:04.080
 and get stuck in that library

1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:05.720
 that you mentioned beforehand

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:08.600
 with a very large number of books.

1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:10.680
 The first agent had this problem.

1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:13.640
 It would get stuck in front of an old TV screen,

1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:14.960
 which has just had white noise.

1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:16.480
 Yeah, white noise, yeah.

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:21.360
 But the second version can deal with at least stochasticity.

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:22.200
 Well.

1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:23.680
 Yeah, what about curiosity?

1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:27.920
 This kind of word, curiosity, creativity,

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:30.880
 is that kind of the reward function being

1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:31.920
 of getting new information?

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:36.920
 Is that similar to idea of kind of injecting exploration

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.880
 for its own sake inside the reward function?

1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:44.880
 Do you find this at all appealing, interesting?

1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:46.320
 I think that's a nice definition.

1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:48.600
 Curiosity is rewards.

1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:53.600
 Sorry, curiosity is exploration for its own sake.

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:56.200
 Yeah, I would accept that.

1:11:57.120 --> 1:11:59.920
 But most curiosity, well, in humans,

1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:01.240
 and especially in children,

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.040
 is not just for its own sake,

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:05.960
 but for actually learning about the environment

1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:08.440
 and for behaving better.

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:13.120
 So I think most curiosity is tied in the end

1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:14.840
 towards performing better.

1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:17.680
 Well, okay, so if intelligence systems

1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:19.760
 need to have this reward function,

1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:22.360
 let me, you're an intelligence system,

1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:26.600
 currently passing the torrent test quite effectively.

1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:30.240
 What's the reward function

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:33.920
 of our human intelligence existence?

1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:35.160
 What's the reward function

1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:37.720
 that Marcus Hutter is operating under?

1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.760
 Okay, to the first question,

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:44.480
 the biological reward function is to survive and to spread,

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:48.200
 and very few humans sort of are able to overcome

1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:49.920
 this biological reward function.

1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:54.200
 But we live in a very nice world

1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:56.240
 where we have lots of spare time

1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:57.640
 and can still survive and spread,

1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:01.920
 so we can develop arbitrary other interests,

1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:03.280
 which is quite interesting.

1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:04.400
 On top of that.

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:06.160
 On top of that, yeah.

1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:09.120
 But the survival and spreading sort of is,

1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:13.160
 I would say, the goal or the reward function of humans,

1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.360
 so that the core one.

1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:17.480
 I like how you avoided answering the second question,

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:19.760
 which a good intelligence system would.

1:13:19.760 --> 1:13:20.880
 So my.

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:24.320
 That your own meaning of life and the reward function.

1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:26.960
 My own meaning of life and reward function

1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:29.560
 is to find an AGI to build it.

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:32.040
 Beautifully put.

1:13:32.040 --> 1:13:34.280
 Okay, let's dissect the X even further.

1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:37.960
 So one of the assumptions is kind of infinity

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.680
 keeps creeping up everywhere,

1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:44.680
 which, what are your thoughts

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:46.920
 on kind of bounded rationality

1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:50.040
 and sort of the nature of our existence

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:52.000
 and intelligence systems is that we're operating

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.680
 always under constraints, under limited time,

1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:57.640
 limited resources.

1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:59.480
 How does that, how do you think about that

1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:01.600
 within the IXE framework,

1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:04.480
 within trying to create an AGI system

1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.760
 that operates under these constraints?

1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:09.200
 Yeah, that is one of the criticisms about IXE,

1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:11.320
 that it ignores computation and completely.

1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:13.800
 And some people believe that intelligence

1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:18.800
 is inherently tied to what's bounded resources.

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:21.160
 What do you think on this one point?

1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:22.480
 Do you think it's,

1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:23.920
 do you think the bounded resources

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:25.640
 are fundamental to intelligence?

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:31.160
 I would say that an intelligence notion,

1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:35.520
 which ignores computational limits is extremely useful.

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:37.120
 A good intelligence notion,

1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:40.720
 which includes these resources would be even more useful,

1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:42.160
 but we don't have that yet.

1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:48.280
 And so look at other fields outside of computer science,

1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:52.240
 computational aspects never play a fundamental role.

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:54.880
 You develop biological models for cells,

1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.680
 something in physics, these theories,

1:14:56.680 --> 1:14:58.160
 I mean, become more and more crazy

1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:00.320
 and harder and harder to compute.

1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:01.440
 Well, in the end, of course,

1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:02.960
 we need to do something with this model,

1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:05.520
 but this is more a nuisance than a feature.

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:10.040
 And I'm sometimes wondering if artificial intelligence

1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:12.080
 would not sit in a computer science department,

1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:14.040
 but in a philosophy department,

1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:16.120
 then this computational focus

1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:18.400
 would be probably significantly less.

1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:19.720
 I mean, think about the induction problem

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:22.080
 is more in the philosophy department.

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:24.480
 There's virtually no paper who cares about,

1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:26.440
 how long it takes to compute the answer.

1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:28.320
 That is completely secondary.

1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:31.680
 Of course, once we have figured out the first problem,

1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:35.840
 so intelligence without computational resources,

1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:39.400
 then the next and very good question is,

1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:42.480
 could we improve it by including computational resources,

1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:45.520
 but nobody was able to do that so far

1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:47.800
 in an even halfway satisfactory manner.

1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:51.600
 I like that, that in the long run,

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:54.000
 the right department to belong to is philosophy.

1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:58.680
 That's actually quite a deep idea,

1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:01.440
 or even to at least to think about

1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:03.680
 big picture philosophical questions,

1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:05.280
 big picture questions,

1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:07.400
 even in the computer science department.

1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:10.000
 But you've mentioned approximation.

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.160
 Sort of, there's a lot of infinity,

1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:13.920
 a lot of huge resources needed.

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:16.280
 Are there approximations to IXE

1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:19.800
 that within the IXE framework that are useful?

1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:23.120
 Yeah, we have developed a couple of approximations.

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:27.280
 And what we do there is that

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:29.840
 the Solomov induction part,

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:33.640
 which was find the shortest program describing your data,

1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:36.640
 we just replace it by standard data compressors.

1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:39.240
 And the better compressors get,

1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:41.680
 the better this part will become.

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.400
 We focus on a particular compressor

1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:44.560
 called context tree weighting,

1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:48.520
 which is pretty amazing, not so well known.

1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:50.120
 It has beautiful theoretical properties,

1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:52.240
 also works reasonably well in practice.

1:16:52.240 --> 1:16:55.160
 So we use that for the approximation of the induction

1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:58.160
 and the learning and the prediction part.

1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:01.680
 And for the planning part,

1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:05.560
 we essentially just took the ideas from a computer go

1:17:05.560 --> 1:17:07.320
 from 2006.

1:17:07.320 --> 1:17:10.440
 It was Java Zipes Bari, also now at DeepMind,

1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:14.600
 who developed the so called UCT algorithm,

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:17.440
 upper confidence bound for trees algorithm

1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:19.040
 on top of the Monte Carlo tree search.

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:23.200
 So we approximate this planning part by sampling.

1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:28.200
 And it's successful on some small toy problems.

1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:33.480
 We don't want to lose the generality, right?

1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:34.920
 And that's sort of the handicap, right?

1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:38.840
 If you want to be general, you have to give up something.

1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:41.960
 So, but this single agent was able to play small games

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:46.960
 like Coon poker and Tic Tac Toe and even Pacman

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:52.040
 in the same architecture, no change.

1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:54.880
 The agent doesn't know the rules of the game,

1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:57.640
 really nothing and all by self or by a player

1:17:57.640 --> 1:17:58.840
 with these environments.

1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.800
 So Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed something called

1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:06.920
 Ghetto Machines, which is a self improving program

1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:08.400
 that rewrites its own code.

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:12.800
 Sort of mathematically, philosophically,

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.080
 what's the relationship in your eyes,

1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:16.160
 if you're familiar with it,

1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:18.400
 between AXI and the Ghetto Machines?

1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:19.720
 Yeah, familiar with it.

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:22.320
 He developed it while I was in his lab.

1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:26.200
 Yeah, so the Ghetto Machine, to explain it briefly,

1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:28.920
 you give it a task.

1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:30.400
 It could be a simple task as, you know,

1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:32.480
 finding prime factors in numbers, right?

1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:33.840
 You can formally write it down.

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:35.280
 There's a very slow algorithm to do that.

1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:37.520
 Just try all the factors, yeah.

1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:39.240
 Or play chess, right?

1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:41.200
 Optimally, you write the algorithm to minimax

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:42.080
 to the end of the game.

1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.360
 So you write down what the Ghetto Machine should do.

1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:50.360
 Then it will take part of its resources to run this program

1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:54.000
 and other part of its resources to improve this program.

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.880
 And when it finds an improved version,

1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:00.680
 which provably computes the same answer.

1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:02.320
 So that's the key part, yeah.

1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:05.680
 It needs to prove by itself that this change of program

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:08.960
 still satisfies the original specification.

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:11.680
 And if it does so, then it replaces the original program

1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:13.120
 by the improved program.

1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:15.120
 And by definition, it does the same job,

1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:17.080
 but just faster, okay?

1:19:17.080 --> 1:19:19.160
 And then, you know, it proves over it and over it.

1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:24.160
 And it's developed in a way that all parts

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:26.720
 of this Ghetto Machine can self improve,

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:29.160
 but it stays provably consistent

1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:31.760
 with the original specification.

1:19:31.760 --> 1:19:36.080
 So from this perspective, it has nothing to do with iXe.

1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:40.520
 But if you would now put iXe as the starting axioms in,

1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:44.800
 it would run iXe, but you know, that takes forever.

1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:48.480
 But then if it finds a provable speed up of iXe,

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:50.960
 it would replace it by this and this and this.

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:52.840
 And maybe eventually it comes up with a model

1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:54.480
 which is still the iXe model.

1:19:54.480 --> 1:19:59.480
 It cannot be, I mean, just for the knowledgeable reader,

1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:03.200
 iXe is incomputable and that can prove that therefore

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:08.200
 there cannot be a computable exact algorithm computers.

1:20:08.640 --> 1:20:10.360
 There needs to be some approximations

1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:11.960
 and this is not dealt with the Ghetto Machine.

1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:13.200
 So you have to do something about it.

1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:15.680
 But there's the iXe TL model, which is finitely computable,

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:16.520
 which we could put in.

1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:19.240
 Which part of iXe is noncomputable?

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.760
 The Solomonov induction part.

1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:22.240
 The induction, okay, so.

1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:26.320
 But there is ways of getting computable approximations

1:20:26.320 --> 1:20:30.000
 of the iXe model, so then it's at least computable.

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:33.680
 It is still way beyond any resources anybody will ever have,

1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:35.840
 but then the Ghetto Machine could sort of improve it

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:37.720
 further and further in an exact way.

1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:41.160
 So is it theoretically possible

1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:45.120
 that the Ghetto Machine process could improve?

1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:50.120
 Isn't iXe already optimal?

1:20:51.800 --> 1:20:56.760
 It is optimal in terms of the reward collected

1:20:56.760 --> 1:20:59.360
 over its interaction cycles,

1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:03.440
 but it takes infinite time to produce one action.

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:07.120
 And the world continues whether you want it or not.

1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:09.720
 So the model is assuming you had an oracle,

1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:11.200
 which solved this problem,

1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:12.920
 and then in the next 100 milliseconds

1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:15.360
 or the reaction time you need gives the answer,

1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:16.640
 then iXe is optimal.

1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:21.440
 It's optimal in sense of also from learning efficiency

1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:25.600
 and data efficiency, but not in terms of computation time.

1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:27.560
 And then the Ghetto Machine in theory,

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:31.000
 but probably not provably could make it go faster.

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:31.840
 Yes.

1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:34.520
 Okay, interesting.

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.640
 Those two components are super interesting.

1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:39.960
 The sort of the perfect intelligence combined

1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:42.920
 with self improvement,

1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:45.600
 sort of provable self improvement

1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:48.760
 since you're always getting the correct answer

1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.360
 and you're improving.

1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:51.400
 Beautiful ideas.

1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:55.120
 Okay, so you've also mentioned that different kinds

1:21:55.120 --> 1:21:59.840
 of things in the chase of solving this reward,

1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:01.740
 sort of optimizing for the goal,

1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:04.960
 interesting human things could emerge.

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:08.820
 So is there a place for consciousness within iXe?

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:13.480
 Where does, maybe you can comment,

1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:17.440
 because I suppose we humans are just another instantiation

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:20.880
 of iXe agents and we seem to have consciousness.

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:23.400
 You say humans are an instantiation of an iXe agent?

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:24.240
 Yes.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:25.280
 Well, that would be amazing,

1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:27.880
 but I think that's not true even for the smartest

1:22:27.880 --> 1:22:29.000
 and most rational humans.

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.920
 I think maybe we are very crude approximations.

1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:33.760
 Interesting.

1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:35.720
 I mean, I tend to believe, again, I'm Russian,

1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:40.720
 so I tend to believe our flaws are part of the optimal.

1:22:41.160 --> 1:22:45.640
 So we tend to laugh off and criticize our flaws

1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:49.240
 and I tend to think that that's actually close

1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:50.680
 to an optimal behavior.

1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:53.760
 Well, some flaws, if you think more carefully about it,

1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:54.960
 are actually not flaws, yeah,

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:57.760
 but I think there are still enough flaws.

1:22:58.920 --> 1:23:00.000
 I don't know.

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:00.840
 It's unclear.

1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:01.880
 As a student of history,

1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:05.240
 I think all the suffering that we've endured

1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:06.760
 as a civilization,

1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:10.200
 it's possible that that's the optimal amount of suffering

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:13.800
 we need to endure to minimize longterm suffering.

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.280
 That's your Russian background, I think.

1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:18.120
 That's the Russian.

1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:21.840
 Whether humans are or not instantiations of an iXe agent,

1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:23.920
 do you think there's a consciousness

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:25.640
 of something that could emerge

1:23:25.640 --> 1:23:29.720
 in a computational form or framework like iXe?

1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:31.720
 Let me also ask you a question.

1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:33.040
 Do you think I'm conscious?

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:38.200
 Yeah, that's a good question.

1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:43.200
 That tie is confusing me, but I think so.

1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:45.720
 You think that makes me unconscious

1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:47.160
 because it strangles me or?

1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:49.720
 If an agent were to solve the imitation game

1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:50.600
 posed by Turing,

1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:53.400
 I think that would be dressed similarly to you.

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:56.800
 That because there's a kind of flamboyant,

1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:01.040
 interesting, complex behavior pattern

1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:04.440
 that sells that you're human and you're conscious.

1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:06.080
 But why do you ask?

1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:07.880
 Was it a yes or was it a no?

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:12.640
 Yes, I think you're conscious, yes.

1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:16.080
 So, and you explained sort of somehow why,

1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:18.760
 but you infer that from my behavior, right?

1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:20.680
 You can never be sure about that.

1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:23.280
 And I think the same thing will happen

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:26.760
 with any intelligent agent we develop

1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:31.000
 if it behaves in a way sufficiently close to humans

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.080
 or maybe even not humans.

1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:34.240
 I mean, maybe a dog is also sometimes

1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:35.720
 a little bit self conscious, right?

1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:38.800
 So if it behaves in a way

1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:41.160
 where we attribute typically consciousness,

1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.720
 we would attribute consciousness

1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:44.320
 to these intelligent systems.

1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:47.240
 And I see probably in particular

1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:48.800
 that of course doesn't answer the question

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:50.800
 whether it's really conscious.

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:53.680
 And that's the big hard problem of consciousness.

1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:55.680
 Maybe I'm a zombie.

1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:59.320
 I mean, not the movie zombie, but the philosophical zombie.

1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:02.600
 Is to you the display of consciousness

1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:05.000
 close enough to consciousness

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.720
 from a perspective of AGI

1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:09.800
 that the distinction of the hard problem of consciousness

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.320
 is not an interesting one?

1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:12.480
 I think we don't have to worry

1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:13.920
 about the consciousness problem,

1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:16.840
 especially the hard problem for developing AGI.

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:20.200
 I think, you know, we progress.

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:23.120
 At some point we have solved all the technical problems

1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:25.440
 and this system will behave intelligent

1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:26.520
 and then super intelligent.

1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:30.160
 And this consciousness will emerge.

1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:32.480
 I mean, definitely it will display behavior

1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:35.040
 which we will interpret as conscious.

1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:38.120
 And then it's a philosophical question.

1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:39.840
 Did this consciousness really emerge

1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:43.680
 or is it a zombie which just, you know, fakes everything?

1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:45.200
 We still don't have to figure that out.

1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:47.480
 Although it may be interesting,

1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:48.920
 at least from a philosophical point of view,

1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:49.840
 it's very interesting,

1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.160
 but it may also be sort of practically interesting.

1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:54.280
 You know, there's some people saying,

1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:56.200
 if it's just faking consciousness and feelings,

1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:58.280
 you know, then we don't need to be concerned about,

1:25:58.280 --> 1:25:59.160
 you know, rights.

1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:01.600
 But if it's real conscious and has feelings,

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:03.400
 then we need to be concerned, yeah.

1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:07.560
 I can't wait till the day

1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:10.640
 where AI systems exhibit consciousness

1:26:10.640 --> 1:26:14.520
 because it'll truly be some of the hardest ethical questions

1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:15.640
 of what we do with that.

1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:18.880
 It is rather easy to build systems

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:21.120
 which people ascribe consciousness.

1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:22.600
 And I give you an analogy.

1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:25.320
 I mean, remember, maybe it was before you were born,

1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:26.760
 the Tamagotchi?

1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:27.880
 Yeah.

1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:28.760
 Freaking born.

1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:29.800
 How dare you, sir?

1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:33.240
 Why, that's the, you're young, right?

1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:34.080
 Yes, that's good.

1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:36.200
 Thank you, thank you very much.

1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:37.560
 But I was also in the Soviet Union.

1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:41.240
 We didn't have any of those fun things.

1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:42.680
 But you have heard about this Tamagotchi,

1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:44.600
 which was, you know, really, really primitive,

1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.920
 actually, for the time it was,

1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:48.840
 and, you know, you could raise, you know, this,

1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:51.640
 and kids got so attached to it

1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:53.600
 and, you know, didn't want to let it die

1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:56.920
 and probably, if we would have asked, you know,

1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:59.520
 the children, do you think this Tamagotchi is conscious?

1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:00.360
 They would have said yes.

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.600
 Half of them would have said yes, I would guess.

1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:04.720
 I think that's kind of a beautiful thing, actually,

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:08.640
 because that consciousness, ascribing consciousness,

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:10.440
 seems to create a deeper connection.

1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:11.280
 Yeah.

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:12.600
 Which is a powerful thing.

1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:15.880
 But we'll have to be careful on the ethics side of that.

1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:18.440
 Well, let me ask about the AGI community broadly.

1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:22.600
 You kind of represent some of the most serious work on AGI,

1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:24.280
 as of at least earlier,

1:27:24.280 --> 1:27:29.280
 and DeepMind represents serious work on AGI these days.

1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:34.080
 But why, in your sense, is the AGI community so small

1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:38.120
 or has been so small until maybe DeepMind came along?

1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:41.680
 Like, why aren't more people seriously working

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:45.840
 on human level and superhuman level intelligence

1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:47.360
 from a formal perspective?

1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:49.680
 Okay, from a formal perspective,

1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:52.560
 that's sort of an extra point.

1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:54.960
 So I think there are a couple of reasons.

1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:56.680
 I mean, AI came in waves, right?

1:27:56.680 --> 1:27:58.520
 You know, AI winters and AI summers,

1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:01.520
 and then there were big promises which were not fulfilled,

1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:05.760
 and people got disappointed.

1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:10.760
 And that narrow AI solving particular problems,

1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:14.040
 which seemed to require intelligence,

1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:17.000
 was always to some extent successful,

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.480
 and there were improvements, small steps.

1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:24.240
 And if you build something which is useful for society

1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:26.600
 or industrial useful, then there's a lot of funding.

1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:28.520
 So I guess it was in parts the money,

1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:34.200
 which drives people to develop a specific system

1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:36.240
 solving specific tasks.

1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:38.760
 But you would think that, at least in university,

1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:42.800
 you should be able to do ivory tower research.

1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:46.000
 And that was probably better a long time ago,

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.280
 but even nowadays, there's quite some pressure

1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:52.240
 of doing applied research or translational research,

1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:56.640
 and it's harder to get grants as a theorist.

1:28:56.640 --> 1:28:59.920
 So that also drives people away.

1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:01.520
 It's maybe also harder

1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:03.120
 attacking the general intelligence problem.

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:05.880
 So I think enough people, I mean, maybe a small number

1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:09.560
 were still interested in formalizing intelligence

1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:12.880
 and thinking of general intelligence,

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:17.560
 but not much came up, right?

1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:19.880
 Well, not much great stuff came up.

1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:21.360
 So what do you think,

1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:24.840
 we talked about the formal big light

1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:26.160
 at the end of the tunnel,

1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:27.600
 but from the engineering perspective,

1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:30.360
 what do you think it takes to build an AGI system?

1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:33.920
 Is that, and I don't know if that's a stupid question

1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:35.120
 or a distinct question

1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:37.160
 from everything we've been talking about at AICSI,

1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:41.040
 but what do you see as the steps that are necessary to take

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:43.040
 to start to try to build something?

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:44.360
 So you want a blueprint now,

1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:46.360
 and then you go off and do it?

1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:48.040
 That's the whole point of this conversation,

1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:49.800
 trying to squeeze that in there.

1:29:49.800 --> 1:29:51.560
 Now, is there, I mean, what's your intuition?

1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:53.960
 Is it in the robotics space

1:29:53.960 --> 1:29:56.800
 or something that has a body and tries to explore the world?

1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:58.960
 Is it in the reinforcement learning space,

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:01.000
 like the efforts with AlphaZero and AlphaStar

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.360
 that are kind of exploring how you can solve it through

1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:06.720
 in the simulation in the gaming world?

1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:11.440
 Is there stuff in sort of all the transformer work

1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:13.200
 and natural English processing,

1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:15.800
 sort of maybe attacking the open domain dialogue?

1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:18.720
 Like what, where do you see a promising pathways?

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:24.520
 Let me pick the embodiment maybe.

1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:29.520
 So embodiment is important, yes and no.

1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:38.160
 I don't believe that we need a physical robot

1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:42.080
 walking or rolling around, interacting with the real world

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:45.080
 in order to achieve AGI.

1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:50.080
 And I think it's more of a distraction probably

1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:54.560
 than helpful, it's sort of confusing the body with the mind.

1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:58.920
 For industrial applications or near term applications,

1:30:58.920 --> 1:31:01.200
 of course we need robots for all kinds of things,

1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:06.200
 but for solving the big problem, at least at this stage,

1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:08.120
 I think it's not necessary.

1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:10.080
 But the answer is also yes,

1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:13.240
 that I think the most promising approach

1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:15.280
 is that you have an agent

1:31:15.280 --> 1:31:18.480
 and that can be a virtual agent in a computer

1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:20.120
 interacting with an environment,

1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:22.560
 possibly a 3D simulated environment

1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:24.120
 like in many computer games.

1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:28.880
 And you train and learn the agent,

1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:33.120
 even if you don't intend to later put it sort of,

1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:35.560
 this algorithm in a robot brain

1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:38.560
 and leave it forever in the virtual reality,

1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:40.520
 getting experience in a,

1:31:40.520 --> 1:31:43.680
 although it's just simulated 3D world,

1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:47.960
 is possibly, and I say possibly,

1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:51.600
 important to understand things

1:31:51.600 --> 1:31:53.880
 on a similar level as humans do,

1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:58.560
 especially if the agent or primarily if the agent

1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:00.320
 needs to interact with the humans.

1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:02.960
 If you talk about objects on top of each other in space

1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.760
 and flying and cars and so on,

1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:06.400
 and the agent has no experience

1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:09.560
 with even virtual 3D worlds,

1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:11.120
 it's probably hard to grasp.

1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:14.520
 So if you develop an abstract agent,

1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:16.720
 say we take the mathematical path

1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:18.320
 and we just want to build an agent

1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:19.480
 which can prove theorems

1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:21.760
 and becomes a better and better mathematician,

1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:24.520
 then this agent needs to be able to reason

1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:25.960
 in very abstract spaces

1:32:25.960 --> 1:32:28.920
 and then maybe sort of putting it into 3D environments,

1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:30.480
 simulated or not is even harmful.

1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:33.400
 It should sort of, you put it in, I don't know,

1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:35.840
 an environment which it creates itself or so.

1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:38.760
 It seems like you have a interesting, rich,

1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:40.680
 complex trajectory through life

1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:42.680
 in terms of your journey of ideas.

1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:45.760
 So it's interesting to ask what books,

1:32:45.760 --> 1:32:48.120
 technical, fiction, philosophical,

1:32:49.080 --> 1:32:52.680
 books, ideas, people had a transformative effect.

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:53.800
 Books are most interesting

1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:57.280
 because maybe people could also read those books

1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:00.120
 and see if they could be inspired as well.

1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:03.520
 Yeah, luckily I asked books and not singular book.

1:33:03.520 --> 1:33:08.120
 It's very hard and I try to pin down one book.

1:33:08.120 --> 1:33:10.520
 And I can do that at the end.

1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:14.200
 So the most,

1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:16.360
 the books which were most transformative for me

1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:19.600
 or which I can most highly recommend

1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:21.920
 to people interested in AI.

1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:22.880
 Both perhaps.

1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:25.440
 Yeah, yeah, both, both, yeah, yeah.

1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:28.560
 I would always start with Russell and Norvig,

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:30.880
 Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach.

1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:33.400
 That's the AI Bible.

1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:35.000
 It's an amazing book.

1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:36.320
 It's very broad.

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:38.800
 It covers all approaches to AI.

1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:40.840
 And even if you focused on one approach,

1:33:40.840 --> 1:33:42.520
 I think that is the minimum you should know

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:44.600
 about the other approaches out there.

1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:46.200
 So that should be your first book.

1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:48.320
 Fourth edition should be coming out soon.

1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:50.040
 Oh, okay, interesting.

1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:51.480
 There's a deep learning chapter now,

1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:53.080
 so there must be.

1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:55.560
 Written by Ian Goodfellow, okay.

1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:59.680
 And then the next book I would recommend,

1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:02.920
 The Reinforcement Learning Book by Satneen Barto.

1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:04.440
 That's a beautiful book.

1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:06.920
 If there's any problem with the book,

1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:11.920
 it makes RL feel and look much easier than it actually is.

1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:14.800
 It's very gentle book.

1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:16.760
 It's very nice to read, the exercises to do.

1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:19.520
 You can very quickly get some RL systems to run.

1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:22.520
 You know, very toy problems, but it's a lot of fun.

1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:27.520
 And in a couple of days you feel you know what RL is about,

1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:30.560
 but it's much harder than the book.

1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:31.400
 Yeah.

1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:34.840
 Oh, come on now, it's an awesome book.

1:34:34.840 --> 1:34:36.240
 Yeah, it is, yeah.

1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:41.240
 And maybe, I mean, there's so many books out there.

1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:43.440
 If you like the information theoretic approach,

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:46.760
 then there's Kolmogorov Complexity by Alin Vitani,

1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:50.800
 but probably, you know, some short article is enough.

1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:52.120
 You don't need to read a whole book,

1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:54.440
 but it's a great book.

1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:59.440
 And if you have to mention one all time favorite book,

1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:01.880
 it's of different flavor, that's a book

1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:04.800
 which is used in the International Baccalaureate

1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:08.560
 for high school students in several countries.

1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:12.520
 That's from Nicholas Alchin, Theory of Knowledge,

1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:16.120
 second edition or first, not the third, please.

1:35:16.120 --> 1:35:18.480
 The third one, they took out all the fun.

1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:20.240
 Okay.

1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:25.240
 So this asks all the interesting,

1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.200
 or to me, interesting philosophical questions

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:30.040
 about how we acquire knowledge from all perspectives,

1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:31.840
 from math, from art, from physics,

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:36.240
 and ask how can we know anything?

1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.040
 And the book is called Theory of Knowledge.

1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:40.720
 From which, is this almost like a philosophical exploration

1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:43.160
 of how we get knowledge from anything?

1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:45.160
 Yes, yeah, I mean, can religion tell us, you know,

1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:46.200
 about something about the world?

1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:48.080
 Can science tell us something about the world?

1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:50.680
 Can mathematics, or is it just playing with symbols?

1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:54.400
 And, you know, it's open ended questions.

1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:56.240
 And, I mean, it's for high school students,

1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:58.320
 so they have then resources from Hitchhiker's Guide

1:35:58.320 --> 1:35:59.960
 to the Galaxy and from Star Wars

1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:01.800
 and The Chicken Crossed the Road, yeah.

1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:05.960
 And it's fun to read, but it's also quite deep.

1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:11.480
 If you could live one day of your life over again,

1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:12.840
 has it made you truly happy?

1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:14.440
 Or maybe like we said with the books,

1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:16.240
 it was truly transformative.

1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:19.120
 What day, what moment would you choose

1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:20.800
 that something pop into your mind?

1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:23.480
 Does it need to be a day in the past,

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:25.920
 or can it be a day in the future?

1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:27.960
 Well, space time is an emergent phenomena,

1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:30.400
 so it's all the same anyway.

1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:32.040
 Okay.

1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:33.360
 Okay, from the past.

1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:36.800
 You're really good at saying from the future, I love it.

1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:39.120
 No, I will tell you from the future, okay.

1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:41.480
 So from the past, I would say

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:43.800
 when I discovered my Axie model.

1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:45.160
 I mean, it was not in one day,

1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:48.880
 but it was one moment where I realized

1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:53.200
 Kolmogorov complexity and didn't even know that it existed,

1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:55.800
 but I discovered sort of this compression idea

1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:58.120
 myself, but immediately I knew I can't be the first one,

1:36:58.120 --> 1:36:59.360
 but I had this idea.

1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:02.200
 And then I knew about sequential decisionry,

1:37:02.200 --> 1:37:06.360
 and I knew if I put it together, this is the right thing.

1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:09.680
 And yeah, still when I think back about this moment,

1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:12.400
 I'm super excited about it.

1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:16.320
 Was there any more details and context that moment?

1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:18.040
 Did an apple fall on your head?

1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:21.960
 So it was like, if you look at Ian Goodfellow

1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:25.920
 talking about GANs, there was beer involved.

1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:30.200
 Is there some more context of what sparked your thought,

1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:31.200
 or was it just?

1:37:31.200 --> 1:37:32.960
 No, it was much more mundane.

1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:34.560
 So I worked in this company.

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:36.160
 So in this sense, the four and a half years

1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:37.640
 was not completely wasted.

1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:43.720
 And I worked on an image interpolation problem,

1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:48.480
 and I developed a quite neat new interpolation techniques

1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:52.240
 and they got patented, which happens quite often.

1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:54.360
 I got sort of overboard and thought about,

1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:56.240
 yeah, that's pretty good, but it's not the best.

1:37:56.240 --> 1:37:59.800
 So what is the best possible way of doing interpolation?

1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:03.200
 And then I thought, yeah, you want the simplest picture,

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:04.760
 which is if you coarse grain it,

1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:06.560
 recovers your original picture.

1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:08.880
 And then I thought about the simplicity concept

1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:11.280
 more in quantitative terms,

1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:14.080
 and then everything developed.

1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:17.120
 And somehow the four beautiful mix

1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:18.920
 of also being a physicist

1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:20.600
 and thinking about the big picture of it,

1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:24.120
 then led you to probably think big with AIX.

1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:26.200
 So as a physicist, I was probably trained

1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:28.440
 not to always think in computational terms,

1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:30.840
 just ignore that and think about

1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:34.000
 the fundamental properties, which you want to have.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.920
 So what about if you could really one day in the future?

1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:39.880
 What would that be?

1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:41.520
 When I solve the AGI problem.

1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:45.120
 In practice, so in theory,

1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:48.680
 I have solved it with the AIX model, but in practice.

1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:50.720
 And then I ask the first question.

1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:53.200
 What would be the first question?

1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:54.600
 What's the meaning of life?

1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:58.400
 I don't think there's a better way to end it.

1:38:58.400 --> 1:38:59.240
 Thank you so much for talking today.

1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:01.360
 It's a huge honor to finally meet you.

1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:02.200
 Yeah, thank you too.

1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:31.880
 It was a pleasure of mine too.

1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:35.760
 And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom

1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:38.000
 from Albert Einstein.

1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:42.040
 The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.

1:39:42.040 --> 1:40:01.600
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
